# Water

I did not intend to make this (book,pamphlet,guide,loose collection of
words ← choose one or several or none) a sensory experience with all,
or a few, senses explored in their very own chapters. In fact there is
a old Spanish ditty that goes

	Dale limosna, mujer
	Que no hay en la vida nada
	Como la pena de ser
	Ciego en Granada

Loosely translated as

	Yo, woman, give him the alms
	Because there is nothing in life
	Like the sorrow of being
	A blind man in Granada

It would be also a real pity if you did not have the pleasure of
tasting tap water in Granada. And this fact is something I have found
rather late in life. Many people prefer the water they have palated in
their hometown, the place where they were born. But in Úbeda, were I was born and raised, water
carried so much lime that taps had to be routinely cleansed and
showers dug out of the calcareous agglomeration they carried. Even so,
it was not like I was getting out of Úbeda and saying, every time I
drank a glass of water, "Hey, this is the stuff".

But that is exactly what happens to me when I get out of Granada. Really. The first time
you stop at a roadside café, two hours into foreign territory, and, it
is all "what the hell, they call *this* water?".

>Except in Vienna. They have wonderful tap water there. So wonderful
>that they created a monument to it right in front of the monument to
>the soviet soldier that they wanted to hide. But that is a completely
>different story. They also have excellent tap water in Iceland, if you let it flow for a good while after having used hot water and the sulphur smell and taste that goes with it. 

Tap water, everywhere in and around Granada, is really good. It is cool
and fresh and does not have the usual tang of chemicals used in
purification. Plus it is really safe. Mostly everywhere in Europe,
really, but the taste and flavor will vary. It is really much better
than most *el cheapo* bottled water and it comes very close to
Lanjarón bottled water since, in fact, they come from pretty much the
same source.

I guess the trick is that it comes fresh from the reservoirs that take
water directly from Sierra Nevada. In
[Canales](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalse_de_Canales), which you
can visit and I encourage you to do so, it is a few kilometers away
from Granada and close to Güéjar Sierra, nice place to eat and to just be,

>It is also the reason why, or one of them at least, why there are no
>tram from Granada to the Sierra. That, too, is a different story.

and [Quéntar](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalse_de_Qu%C3%A9ntar)
water does not have a long run from the snow and ice of the Sierra, so
it is pristine when it, eventually, arrives to your glass.

You will not probably be able to take it home, because it will be
dutifully requisitioned by the airport rent-a-cops, but its taste, or 
complete absence, is
something that will linger on your tongue for a long
time. Guaranteed.

That was probably not the taste that Washington Irving, in his visit
to Granada, enjoyed. Back then, in the first half of the XIXth
century, water was brought to the city by water bearers, *aguadores*,
of whom Washington Irving say:

>Among the water-carriers who once resorted
>to this well, there was a sturdy, strongbacked,
>bandy-legged little fellow, named
>Pedro Gil, but called Peregil for shortness.
>Like all the water-carriers he was a Gallego,
>or native of Gallicia.

Galicia is the northernmost Atlantic region in Spain. Dudes from there
were strong and hard working, and note I have not said "as opposed to"
anywhere here. They just were, and so they were the ones taking care
of the water trade, retrieving it from wells in the hills or even
further up, in the Sierra. Also from the Fuente del Avellano, or
Hazelnut Tree Fountain, whose path starts just downhill from the
Alhambra. Besides obtaining and transporting it,
[the water carriers peddled it in the main streets of Granada](http://brunoalcaraz.blogspot.com.es/2013/09/las-aguas-de-granaday-los-aguadores.html),
becoming the source of naïve and sometimes poignant slogans,

>Who wants more, the dude is leaving!

was one of them. Donkeys or, if they could afford it, mules, were also
decorated with branches, pieces of clothes, banner. They were such a
ubiquitous sight, and so noticed by foreign travelers, that they
recently were given a monument. That guy with the donkey, totally
surrounded by bar tables in the Plaza de la Romanilla, is a life-size
water carrier. Take a look at him and then enjoy water from a fountain
in the same square or around the corner, in the plaza
Bib-Rambla. Water as pure and clear as that peddled by the water
bearers. 

The quality of the water is something that might, in fact, be in the origin of the
city of Granada itself. Besides the fact that "Illiberis" probably
meant, in the original Iberic language, "By the river", meaning
probably Genil or Darro or both, the Alhambra hills are filled with
tunnels that were probably, in its origin, used to mine water, that
is, to extract water out of natural underground sources.

Nowadays there are myriad water sources in Granada. Among the many
blogs devoted to the city,
[Fuentes de Granada](http://fuentesdegranada.blogspot.com.es/) is
exclusively devoted to fountains. But, beyond decorative sources,
there are many water fountains, many more than in any other city I
have known. Old parts of the city have public water fountains, some of
them decorated, many of them moved from its original situation, but
all of them providing the same water, fresh from the mountains.

One of the memories I have from my childhood visits to Granada, where
I had and still have relatives, is to to to the Plaza del Aljibe, or
Cistern Square, between the Alhambra and the Watchtower or Torre de la
Vela, and ask for a glass of water taken from the cisterns below the
Alhambra. Washington Irving describes it thus, in his Tales from the
Alhambra

>At one corner of this place is a Moorish well, cut through the rock to a
>great depth, the water of which is cold as ice and clear as crystal.

I, being a kid, probably would rather have had a Coke and
some fries to go with it, but I still seem to remember the fresh taste
of that water on my tongue, one of the few memories I have from back
then. [You could also buy firewater and sugar](http://granadablogs.com/terecuerdo/2013/07/30/el-quiosco-de-la-plaza-del-ajibe/), being "Agua, azucarillos
y aguardiente", that is, water, sugar cubes and firewater a popular
drink in those days and the title of a musical comedy. The water that
was served was extracted, via a bucket tied to a pulley, directly from
the well.

That kiosk is no longer serving that water. You can, however, buy
generic soda and crisps. And
[maybe water bottles. And have a look at the Albayzín](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Alhambra/@37.1769655,-3.5908501,3a,75y,338.26h,82.5t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sIOEDUUdcz3leSQqACCtrVQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DIOEDUUdcz3leSQqACCtrVQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D301.23172%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x808dd1ef1221a27f!6m1!1e1?hl=es)
and also be amazed about where Google car is able to get, since all
the pedestrian area is so well covered by Google Street View. Maybe it
is just a matter of screen sizes or maybe of extension of Oculus Rift
sales; in a few years, why would any one want to go to some
godforsaken and dusty part of the world to step on old stones when you
can do it comfortably, thermostat set just right, martini of your
favorite brand in hand, in your very own sofa?

Well, maybe because you just have to be there to taste the water.
