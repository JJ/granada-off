# The graffiti pneumonia 

One traveler once wrote about Granada: "It has a massive graffiti
problem". And it is probably true that you cannot walk a few steps without
finding one way of street art or another in Granada; Granada does have
the graffiti pneumonia and the street art flu. Is that a bad thing? Street art is not
concentrated in a few blocks, or even a neighborhood. It is all over
the place, it is evident and, well, it is in occasions a nuisance, so
that is why the anonymous traveler called it a *problem*, and many
locals concur. But
in many more ways it is simply sublime. Which is why we paraphrase the famous rock
and roll riff above, as in flu is not a great thing, but rock and roll
is. Same as graffiti.

A quick primer on street art is in order here. Street art is anything created with
artistic intent outdoors, and take the term *outdoors* in its wider
meaning that might very well include any space that is not private
*and* inhabited.

So it goes from stickers on walls all the way through to decorated walls
in a parking. *Graffiti* is a subset made mainly with paint, usually
spray. This one also goes in many different shapes: stencils are
repetitive and done usually with a cookie-cutter pattern, tags are
quick signature-like drafts, wild-style and throwups are more
elaborated signatures, generally characteristic of a single street artist
or *crew*, which is a collective, blockbusters cover a whole surface
and finally *pieces* or *masterpieces* are elaborate paintings with a
topic, that cover a wall or part of it and have many different colors
and a recognizable topics. Other styles such as pastes are motifs
painted on paper and that are stuck to walls, same as *skins* that are
simply stickers, printed or painted name tags, you know, the ones with
"Hello my name is...". Many other forms of street art are also
possible, from contextual art that leverages preexisting shapes and
colors in the surface it is made to tiles stuck on a wall through
sculptures made with found art or *yarns*, fabric used to wrap trees
and traffic signals. 

Then there are some techniques that are used by writers. 
** Continue here **

One of the main things about Granada is that, not being a big city
like London of New York, it is a showcase for all kinds or flavors of street
art. A short route through a couple of neighborhoods will be enough to
find most types of street art. That indicates also a thriving and
vibrant art scene, with artists and crews developing their career from
its inception as taggers or *bombers* to master pieces in *jams*, or
long walls which are decorated by several artists or crews, mingling
and mixing a masterpiece with the next.

And the main reason why it is so is probably sex. That is *Sex*, or
also *El niño de las pinturas*, an incredibly talented *writer*, which
started with a simple *sex* or *Sex69* tag you can still find everywhere and is
now the main driving force of the street art *scene* nowadays. But
together with him, several factors contribute to its dynamism. First
one is its autonomy. Since there are so many artists and they have
been able to develop a whole outdoor portfolio, they can live off
their art, obviously not from the almost always free and spontaneous
graffiti they throw everywhere, but from commissions either official or
made by bars, restaurants or shop owners. This autonomy also means
that it only depends on itself: it is not tied either to a political
or urban activism group, skate or hip-hop crews or to urban
exploration collectives. In fact, there is no UrbEx going on here that
I know off, although it could obviously be underground and I could be
none the wiser about it.

So it is difficult to say where to start, but since this is about
going off the beaten track, ride the SN3 to the end of the line and
start from there.

As soon as you step down from the bus in its last stop, maybe with
some people who have some business in the Diputación offices or, less
likely, attend the private college across the street,

>buses, they ride daddy's BMW.

you will see a parking lot that
is decorated with a graffiti version of Ronald McDonald, but that is
only a small piece. Trace back your steps to the bus stop, go past the
private academy and get to back of the motorway wall. From that place,
almost a couple of kilometers of graffiti await you, mainly pieces and
wild style, but some amazing stuff made by most of the writers in
Granada in those days, a few years ago. You can recognize, for
instance, [*sendra*, or Ramón Sendra](https://www.instagram.com/rpsendra/) with his picture Samuel L. Jackson made with blobs
of different colors. Also
[Nake](https://www.instagram.com/nakepablo/), a young artist which is
also an illustrator, or
[Rose, a German artist that blossomed in Granada](http://pintandogranada.blogspot.com.es/2015/08/rose.html). And
also some pieces signed LJDA, *Los Jinetes del Apocalipsis*, the
Apocalipsis riders the first
collective created in the 90s and who are, still, active in some
special occasions, mainly jams and other street art meetings. 

You will have a good idea of what to expect everywhere else in the
city, but you will get a better one if you proceed to the Faculty of
Fine Arts. This will have to be on a weekday; due to budget cuts all
the university is shuttered on weekends. Walk through the main gate
through the roundabout and, forgetting about temporary expositions and
cheap writing material which you should have checked out on its own
chapter, make a right until you arrive to the big warehouse. You will
already see graffiti from there: all that area is a showcase of
graffiti made by Fine Arts students and by writers from elsewhere. And
this is something that sets the graffiti scene in Granada apart from
others: at its core there is a certain academic knowledge, but also
the networks and communities that are created in this academic
setting, as opposed to other scenes that coalesce around a particular
neighborhood, the music of political activism scene. In fact, a
Faculty of Fine Arts includes all of them: many stencils in town have
been created as art projects by the students, and the fact that
pieces, and not other kind of graffiti, are so prevalent in Granada is
related to the formal studies that many of them have followed. You
need an idea of composition, color, theme and many other things to
create a piece, something that is not really needed to tag a wall or
even to create a complex wild-style signature.

Many graffiti writers who live and work in Granada have studied there; many writers from elsewhere
have at least followed a few courses here and, obversely, some
students have dabbled with street art at least as a drunken caper some
time in their life. Or maybe they have just worked in this extensive
graffiti farm, where you see all kind of things: from *jams* created
by several artists with aquatic motifs, to a utility closet fully decorated, to areas
overgrown with weeds and with graffiti that have been overwritten with
jokes by someone else. Also a wall decorated with representations of 1
euro coins. A black and red stencil with Darth Vader on a Holy Week
float says "I am your father". Close to the wall, another utility has
a shadow of a person smoking that seems to look at the rest of the
graffiti imprinted in the same place. A bit further to the right a squid holds
a bleeding heart and says "squid love". And to the right of that,
"Graffiti cannot be learned in class". Which is true. Only the street
can teach you street art. 

That might be true, but maybe the class as a collective spawns
graffiti writers and helps them find their voice. That is interesting
about this area: many graffiti writers cannot be found anywhere else
in the city, or maybe in the world. Or, if you find them, they will
have evolved to something different, probably better.

Jump back again into the SN3 and follow it through to almost the other
end of its trip, to the Carretera de la Sierra. This street, which we
mentioned in the chapter that talks about water because it was the way
water merchants took from the Sierra, is visited by tourists only when
they walk from the hotel that sits at its end. It is a unremarkable,
lived in street, which is interesting for many reasons, including the
graffiti in its left hand side. If you leave the SN3 bus at the
beginning of the street, in the first stop,

>And, when you do, look behind your back to check out the remarkable
>steam engine manufactured by Fives Lille. If you are curious about it
>jump to the geek&nerds chapter of this book. Besides, the stop is
>situated exactly by the original garages that housed the
>Sierra trams. 

where, when construction was taking place in the early 2000s, some
incredible graffiti were posted, you walk down the street and you will
see many tags, as anywhere else in the city, and a few wild style
[graffiti by the gas station](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1661887,-3.5842327,3a,75y,72.61h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sugsuqTKC3bqEnwOh6N0hZQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es), which is one of the few gas stations that
remain within the city.

>In front of the gas station there is a ghost twin, still with the
>prices posted in a paper, frozen in a place circa 2000 or so.

Keep walking until you arrive to a
>[slope covered by concrete](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1654858,-3.5817688,3a,75y,34.49h,76.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1svoXKrPEHjIqkb99PcG1MlA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es). This
slope contains one of the most remarkable pieces of site-specific art
in Granada. Right below a billboard, there is a enigmatic face painted
on the concrete protuberances, taking advantage of the *nose* there
and some cavities for the eyes; a bit further down there is a pregnant
woman and a man, side by side, and midway up and to the end of the
place, a maybe-dog or maybe-sheep is using a head-shaped part of the
slope.  By its side and on an
[abandoned hotel](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1654054,-3.5814663,3a,75y,19.43h,87.17t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shsxZeKZk5Hy59ZbYa2GAqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es)
there is a nice graffiti of a girl that blows a dandelion whose fuzz
becomes a flock of birds, an incredibly beautiful and Escheresque
graffiti that you will be able to see now only in Google Maps or if
you climb a ladder.

Keep walking on the same side and you will arrive to one, and then
another, beautifully decorated staircases, a couple of jams that are
presided by a violin player and a baby painted, again, by El Niño de
las Pinturas, feeling comfortable in this painting ground. Those
staircases were created in 2015, and they were going to be completed
with another piece at the end of the street, a thinking boy
beautifully rendered by, again, El Niño de las Pinturas. It is
poignantly incomplete. El Niño, painting the kid, was on a ladder and
he fell down while doing it. In the middle of the night, with cars
passing by, nobody stepped up to help him. So it sits there,
unfinished, as a testimony to the sometimes unhelpful nature of
denizens of this place. 

You might have seen, in one of the decorated staircases in that
street, the acronym LJDA. We will have to move to another place, not
far now as the crow flies, to check out the secret origins of
graffiti in Granada.  In fact, you could follow the ring round for a
few kilometers, but it is better if you take a couple of buses and
go to the Nuevo Los Cármenes stadium. Then look South, in the
direction of the freeway, and will see a mostly dry river.

>That is the river Monachil, the third river in town and the one where
>90% of the locals who you ask will fail to name. 

Follow the river bed to get under the bridge where the motorway
crosses it. You will find a *jam* that was created in the tenth
anniversary of the creation of LJDA. You cannot get more out of the
beaten track than that. There is fact no track, just the compacted
river bed. An gorgeous graffiti depicting the four horsemen and the
inscription LJDA 10th anniversary. It was painted in 2006, and
celebrates 10 years of creativity, generosity and chaos.

*Sex*-Raúl-Niño de las Pinturas himself tells, in an interview in *Escenas del graffiti en
 Granada*, how LJDA were born on a rainy Holy Week day in 1996 by
 Juxa, Mobil, Shogun, Calahad and himself, putting to good use 200
 sprays they brought, by bus, from Düsseldorf the day before. The
 first wall was painted in Cervantes avenue. That wall has
 disappeared, and I have not been able to find anything about it, so
 it is not worth the while that you walk there, but it is interesting
 to check out Yerma street.

>Yerma is the name of a play by Federico García Lorca. Meaning laid to
>waste or infertile, it is metaphorically applied to a woman, one of
>the characters in the play. And it
>is a paradox that this street spawned such a fertile art.

This street is where Calahad and Sex lived in the early 90s, and is
covered in one of the sides by a brick wall. The first graffiti were
simple tags that read Sex or Calahad, and they were accompanied by
others, spirit, spit... The first pieces, already in 94, made by Spit
and others, already show the compressed evolution of the artistic
career that starts with a single black spray and a fast tag and
progresses to increasingly complex pieces, the state we are seeing
today.

>This street is very close to the Instituto de Astrofísica de
>Andalucía, one of the stops in the geek route. Besides, around the
>corner there is a graffiti wall with a astronomic theme. Check it out
>too. 

However, you will see only those twenty years old graffiti as parts of
the palimpsest that Yerma street is now. It is still painted, and some
pieces are quite old, but the piece by el Niño de las Pinturas that
celebrates the street itself is in the middle, it features a bar code
and black and white motifs. Just walk up and down and let the city
talk to you, and return later on to see what has happened. Graffiti
are alive, and sometimes writers *bomb* other writers by writing over
them, although there is a hierarchy of respect: pieces over wildstyle
over throwups over tags. And nobody, ever, will write over anything
done by El Niño de las Pinturas.

Walk down Camino Bajo de Huétor and you will get to the wall where the
inscription
["Ana Mari, do you want to watch Star Wars with me"](https://twitter.com/nlopeztrujillo/status/477370243921477632)
was written. It is the quintessential graffiti, and it also goes
across the lines of the geek culture that we love so much in
Granada. It
[went viral](https://www.google.es/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=%22%C2%BFAna+Mari+quieres+ver+Star+Wars+conmigo%3F%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=ld2QVrHkLPOs8weYj4fIAQ),
getting to a
[list of the 17 best ways to say "I love you" in a wall](http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2015/10/07/articulo/1444214555_993007.html?id_externo_rsoc=FB_CM). It
eventually disappeared, being the wall of a private home and not a
construction site or some official place. Love is forever, but
declarations are, and maybe should be, ephemeral.

>Another inscription,

>in our graffiti wanderings, so I will just mention it right here. 

From there, you can walk straight ahead to the wall of the Escolapios
school, in the [Callejón del Pretorio](https://www.google.es/maps/search/pretorio/@37.1679218,-3.593479,3a,75y,225.18h,86.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sSzMRlWpsrz_Orgkea6e4_A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DSzMRlWpsrz_Orgkea6e4_A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D79.0293%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es).

>This school is still active. José Val del Omar, mentioned in the geek
>chapter, studied here.

This wall contains one of the oldest graffiti that still exist in
Granada. Some parts of it were created in 1993, a graffiti called
"Dragons" and drawn by Spirit and Chapas, but painting continued
in the next year and, even today, the wall is completely covered with
beautiful pieces and wild-style tags, although probably none of the
originals persist; they are just tiny layers of color in the surface
of the wall. This wall might be a result of a technique that graffiti
writers mentioned and that might have been used elsewhere: drop
*bombs* on a wall and make it ugly, do it by night and
unnoticed. Later on, when that wears and the wall looks like a
showcase of urban decay, talk to the owner and ask for permission to
do a beautiful piece, which you do. So this was, in fact,
[authorized and even documented by the local daily, which provided some sprays](http://granadablogs.com/cableados/2014/01/12/1995-cuando-el-nino-de-las-pinturas-era-sex69/). 

This piece is, in fact, beautiful, and the current instance includes Sex,
Nake and many others, including Drew. But the part I like the most is
more or less in the middle and uses the *trompe l'oeil* technique to
simulate a chasm opening in the wall with a figure with elongated arms
grabbing another graffiti to avoid falling. It was created by XNOS,
[which has a few other pieces to his name](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bit-ramone/2436938878),
but he is not so well known by this name, unlike the signatures to the right, Sex, [Rakis](http://pintandogranada.blogspot.com.es/2015/08/rakis.html) and
even LJDA again are still there. [Rakis](https://myspace.com/rakisljda/photos) was born in Düsseldorf and was
the one in charge of bringing sprays to the whole LJDA crew. He
continues
[collaborating to this day](http://veronicasotosanchez.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/pajaureo-con-sex-y-rakis-ogijares.html),
with his wildstyle signatures that blend with the beautiful pieces by
Sex. And in fact, XNOS is also known as
[Pornostars](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bit-ramone/2324581223),
which included people like Reno, Drew and writers from other places
like [Kies](http://www.elrincondelasboquillas.com/kies/). In fact,
either as XNOS or as Pornostars they have
[been going places and decorating walls all over Europe](http://champu-anticaspa.blogspot.com.es/2011/06/arte-callejero-iii.html). 

But let us go across the river, to Granada. For a long time, the
residents in this part of the city said "I am going to Granada" every
time they walked to the city center. But, in fact, we are in a
different neighborhood, different rules.

But the same graffiti. The *Virgen* neighborhood, smack in the city
center, features stencils, pastes and many faces drawn by Sex. Raúl,
Sex, Niño de las Pinturas,
was probably the first one to be considered *all city* that is, a
person that has covered all corners or neighborhoods of the city. From
the Chana to the Zaidín, through the city center, there are few blocks
where el Niño de las Pinturas has not left his particular signature,
with brown hues, beautiful faces and cogs or machinery pieces that
appear everywhere in his work.

However, it is el Realejo neighborhood where he is really prolific and
the place we have to walk over and over again to check whatever new he
has concocted in his mind. Or in other cases what has disappeared,
like
[this amazing cat](https://www.instagram.com/p/z2XNmIxl3Z/?taken-by=gr8graffiti)
that appeared in January 2015 and that promptly was taken down due to
a protest by the neighbors, who said it did not keep the style of the
rest of the houses. Which is blatantly false, since the style of this
particular zone is *defined* by graffiti. However, it is increasingly
difficult for him to write this area, since it is an area specially
protected by the authorities. He cannot even write in places where he
has got the permission of the owner; sometimes he barters with owners
to have their shop decorated in exchange for something. However, when
they apply for a permission from the city hall it is usually
rejected. It is only in some very specific cases when he can actually
work. For instance, the gorgeous "giraffe" at the end of the Molinos
street. A bundle of cables sprouting out of a connection box in a wall
became the head, long neck and spine of a giraffe. Just add splotches of black
spray and four sticks in the same color as the yellowish wall and
you have got a fantastic giraffe. Its use of the cables and box
already there made it a fine example of
[site-specific art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_art)
of which there are just a few in Granada, which  was on the bring of
having one less. This giraffe [disappeared by the end of January  2016](http://www.elbolardo.com/2016/01/28/la-muerte-de-la-jirafa-del-realejo-de-la-que-todo-el-mundo-habla/),
after
[having been there since 2002](http://www.ideal.es/granada/al-dia/201601/30/adios-jirafa-realejo-20160129194650.html)
and having become a part of the [memories of the neighbors](http://granadaimedia.com/entrevista-natalia-de-molina/). However,
it came back, that is, Raúl painted it back, a few days later, after an intervention by the city
[choir, who sang to say goodbye](https://www.facebook.com/Elninodelaspinturass/videos/1039578336065720/)
and the reaction of local and [national media](http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2016/02/05/articulo/1454698711_413983.html). And you can maybe watch it today, at
least while the cables are not removed, which they might be in the
short run. 

Just wander around every single alley and street and you will find
things to contemplate, but there is a blind alley, called Parra de San
Cecilio, and which is right behind the San Cecilio church

>Which is also a decaying exhibition of *trompe l'oeil*.

and one of the places which you *cannot* visit using Google Street
Maps, that is why you will have to go there and be there physically.

You will be glad you did it. On the left hand side, or in front,
depending on how you came in, you will see first a piece with an
intriguing woman and "Las palabras se perderán sin remedio", "The
words will be lost without a solution" combined with trees and
geometric drawings, and it continues, with a yellow background, for
a hundred meters with all kinds of colors and styles, with ghosts,
Urquell the TV star and a checker board, all linked by irregular
tessellations. You can also look at the other side, although the work
is minor and changes from time to time. But get to the end, where a
skull awaits you.

This skull is a great example of contextual art. The teeth, nose stub
and eyes are part of the building. It is only black paint applied to
make the silhouette of the skull pop out by itself. This was the
basement of the Colombia hotel and restaurant, which is abandoned and
derelict, so it is kind of an epitaph too.

Walk back down and let us get to the end of the tour. Although, as Val
del Omar finished his motion pictures, there is "No end" for graffiti
in Granada, even as vandalism sometimes forces crackdowns on what is
only a form of artistic expression. Get to the corner between
Escoriaza and Calle Molinos, to the recently named Joe Strummer
square.

>This is one of the few places I will not have to add words to the
>dictionary for. And it is named for a person, the leader of The Clash, that actually lived in
>Granada for a time. It has been there since 2013, and inaugurated
>with a concert which I attended and who had the drummer boy for the
>Clash actually playing. It was a wonderful experience.

In a radius of 50 meters from the decaying face of Strummer, made by
none other than Sex, several dozens of square meters of the finest
graffiti look at you, most made by Sex himself. The little square to
the right includes a whole house and the husk of another decorated
with browns and beiges and tan. It is nice to watch in spring,
because the golden sun inundates it all, it is incredible to watch in
fall and winter, because the naked branches of the tree will give you
full sight of this incredible corner.

But from there you will see uphill a wall that is decorated up a down,
in a blockbuster that is actually a piece with a kid, a kid that asks
questions, and further up the street, a two-story house painted red,
with a baby on it, and street art all over: a broken TV turned into an
sculpture, and even the little wall that prevents you from falling
over painted with the skyline of the Alhambra.

>And that is the beginning of the Barranco del Abogado, which deserves
>another chapter. You are also a few meters from the Fives-Lille steam
>engine and the "fake engineer" Ricardo de la Cierva street,
>referenced in the geekery chapter.

From there, remember that Granada is a living graffiti jewel. And the
perfect recipe for finding them is just walking off the beaten
track. Just like the rest of the book.
