#The graffiti pneumonia and the street art flu

One traveler once wrote about Granada: "It has a massive graffiti
problem". Because it is true that you cannot walk a few steps without
finding one way of street art or another in Granada. Street art is not
concentrated in a few blocks, or even a neighborhood. It is all over
the place, it is evident and, well, it is in occasions a nuisance. But
in many more it is simply sublime. So, paraphrasing the famous rock
and roll riff, Granada has got the graffiti pneumonia and the street
art flu.

A quick primer on street art here. Street art is anything created with
artistic intent outdoors. So it goes from stickers to decorated walls
in a parking. *Graffiti* is a subset made mainly with paint, usually
spray. This one also goes in many different shapes: stencils are
repetitive and done usually with a cookie-cutter pattern, tags are
quick signature-like drafts, wild-style and throwups are more
elaborated signatures, generally characteristic of a single street artist
or *crew*, which is a collective, blockbusters cover a whole surface
and finally *pieces* or *masterpieces* are elaborate paintings with a
topic, that cover a wall or part of it and have many different colors
and a recognizable topics. Other styles such as pastes are motifs
painted on paper and that are stuck to walls, same as *skins* that are
simply stickers, printed or painted name tags, you know, the ones with
"Hello my name is...". Many other forms of street art are also
possible, from contextual art that leverages preexisting shapes and
colors in the surface it is made to tiles stuck on a wall through
sculptures made with found art or *yarns*, fabric used to wrap trees
and traffic signals.

One of the main things about Granada is that, not being a big city
like London of New York, it is a showcase for all kinds of street
art. A short route through a couple of neighborhoods will be enough to
find most types of street art. That indicates also a thriving and
vibrant art scene, with artists and crews developing their career from
its inception as taggers or *bombers* to master pieces in *jams*, or
long walls which are decorated by several artists or crews, mingling
and mixing a masterpiece with the next.

And the main reason why it is so is probably sex. That is *Sex*, or
also *El niño de las pinturas*, an incredibly talented *writer*, which
started with a simple *sex* or *Sex69* tag you can still find everywhere and is
now the main driving force of the street art *scene* nowadays. But
together with him, several factors contribute to its dynamism. First
one is its autonomy. Since there are so many artists and they have
been able to develop a whole outdoor portfolio, they can live off
their art, obviously not from the almost always free and spontaneous
graffiti they throw everywhere, but from commissions either official or
made by bars, restaurants or shop owners. This autonomy also means
that it only depends on itself: it is not tied either to a political
or urban activism group, skate or hip-hop crews or to urban
exploration collectives. In fact, there is no UrbEx going on here that
I know off, although it could obviously be underground and I could be
none the wiser about it.

So it is difficult to say where to start, but since this is about
going off the beaten track, ride the SN3 to the end of the line and
start there.

As soon as you step down from the bus, you will see a parking lot that
is decorated with a graffiti version of Ronald McDonald, but that is
only a small piece. Trace back your steps to the bus stop, go past the
private academy and get to back of the motorway wall. From that place,
almost a couple of kilometers of graffiti await you, mainly pieces and
wild style, but some amazing stuff made by most of the writers in
Granada in those days, a few years ago. You can recognize, for
instance, [*sendra*, or Ramón Sendra](https://www.instagram.com/rpsendra/) with his picture Samuel L. Jackson made with blobs
of different colors. Also
[Nake](https://www.instagram.com/nakepablo/), a young artist which is
also an illustrator, or
[Rose, a German artist that blossomed in Granada](http://pintandogranada.blogspot.com.es/2015/08/rose.html). And
also some pieces signed LJDA, *Los Jinetes del Apocalipsis*, the
Apocalipsis riders the first
collective created in the 90s and who are, still, active in some
special occasions.

And you will have to travel to the other part of town to find out a
bit more about them. In fact, you could follow the freeway for around
fifteen kilometers, but it is better if you take a couple of buses and
go to the Nuevo Los Cármenes stadium. Then look South, in the
direction of the freeway, and will see a mostly dry river.

>That is the river Monachil, the third river in town and the one where
>90% of the locals who you ask will fail.

Follow the river bed to get under the bridge where the motorway
crosses it. You will find a *jam* that was created in the tenth
anniversary of the creation of LJDA. You cannot get more out of the
beaten track than that. There is fact no track, just the compacted
river bed. An gorgeous graffiti depicting the four horsemen and the
inscription LJDA 10th anniversary. It was painted in 2006, and
celebrates 10 years of creativity, generosity and chaos.

*Sex*-Raúl-Niño de las Pinturas himself tells, in an interview in *Escenas del graffiti en
 Granada*, how LJDA were born on a rainy Holy Week day in 1996 by
 Juxa, Mobil, Shogun, Calahad and himself, putting to good use 200
 sprays they brought, by bus, from Düsseldorf the day before. The
 first wall was painted in Cervantes avenue. That wall has
 disappeared, and I have not been able to find anything about it, so
 it is not worth the while that you walk there, but it is interesting
 to check out Yerma street.

>Yerma is the name of a play by Federico García Lorca. Meaning laid to
>waste or infertile, it is metaphorically applied to a woman. And it
>is a paradox that this street spawned such a fertile art.

This street is where Calahad and Sex lived in the early 90s, and is
covered in one of the sides by a brick wall. The first graffiti were
simple tags that read Sex or Calahad, and they were accompanied by
others, spirit, spit... The first pieces, already in 94, made by Spit
and others, already show the compressed evolution of the artistic
career that starts with a single black spray and a fast tag and
progresses to increasingly complex pieces, the state we are seeing
today.

However, you will see only those twenty years old graffiti as parts of
the palimpsest that Yerma street is now. It is still painted, and some
pieces are quite old, but the piece by el Niño de las Pinturas that
celebrates the street itself is in the middle, it features a bar code
and black and white motifs. Just walk up and down and let the city
talk to you, and return later on to see what has happened. Graffiti
are alive, and sometimes writers *bomb* other writers by writing over
them, although there is a hierarchy of respect: pieces over wildstyle
over throwups over tags. And nobody, ever, will write over anything
done by El Niño de las Pinturas.
