#The graffiti pneumonia and the street art flu

One traveler once wrote about Granada: "It has a massive graffiti
problem". Because it is true that you cannot walk a few steps without
finding one way of street art or another in Granada. Street art is not
concentrated in a few blocks, or even a neighborhood. It is all over
the place, it is evident and, well, it is in occasions a nuisance. But
in many more it is simply sublime. So, paraphrasing the famous rock
and roll riff, Granada has got the graffiti pneumonia and the street
art flu.

A quick primer on street art is in order here. Street art is anything created with
artistic intent outdoors. So it goes from stickers to decorated walls
in a parking. *Graffiti* is a subset made mainly with paint, usually
spray. This one also goes in many different shapes: stencils are
repetitive and done usually with a cookie-cutter pattern, tags are
quick signature-like drafts, wild-style and throwups are more
elaborated signatures, generally characteristic of a single street artist
or *crew*, which is a collective, blockbusters cover a whole surface
and finally *pieces* or *masterpieces* are elaborate paintings with a
topic, that cover a wall or part of it and have many different colors
and a recognizable topics. Other styles such as pastes are motifs
painted on paper and that are stuck to walls, same as *skins* that are
simply stickers, printed or painted name tags, you know, the ones with
"Hello my name is...". Many other forms of street art are also
possible, from contextual art that leverages preexisting shapes and
colors in the surface it is made to tiles stuck on a wall through
sculptures made with found art or *yarns*, fabric used to wrap trees
and traffic signals.

One of the main things about Granada is that, not being a big city
like London of New York, it is a showcase for all kinds of street
art. A short route through a couple of neighborhoods will be enough to
find most types of street art. That indicates also a thriving and
vibrant art scene, with artists and crews developing their career from
its inception as taggers or *bombers* to master pieces in *jams*, or
long walls which are decorated by several artists or crews, mingling
and mixing a masterpiece with the next.

And the main reason why it is so is probably sex. That is *Sex*, or
also *El niño de las pinturas*, an incredibly talented *writer*, which
started with a simple *sex* or *Sex69* tag you can still find everywhere and is
now the main driving force of the street art *scene* nowadays. But
together with him, several factors contribute to its dynamism. First
one is its autonomy. Since there are so many artists and they have
been able to develop a whole outdoor portfolio, they can live off
their art, obviously not from the almost always free and spontaneous
graffiti they throw everywhere, but from commissions either official or
made by bars, restaurants or shop owners. This autonomy also means
that it only depends on itself: it is not tied either to a political
or urban activism group, skate or hip-hop crews or to urban
exploration collectives. In fact, there is no UrbEx going on here that
I know off, although it could obviously be underground and I could be
none the wiser about it.

So it is difficult to say where to start, but since this is about
going off the beaten track, ride the SN3 to the end of the line and
start from there.

As soon as you step down from the bus, you will see a parking lot that
is decorated with a graffiti version of Ronald McDonald, but that is
only a small piece. Trace back your steps to the bus stop, go past the
private academy and get to back of the motorway wall. From that place,
almost a couple of kilometers of graffiti await you, mainly pieces and
wild style, but some amazing stuff made by most of the writers in
Granada in those days, a few years ago. You can recognize, for
instance, [*sendra*, or Ramón Sendra](https://www.instagram.com/rpsendra/) with his picture Samuel L. Jackson made with blobs
of different colors. Also
[Nake](https://www.instagram.com/nakepablo/), a young artist which is
also an illustrator, or
[Rose, a German artist that blossomed in Granada](http://pintandogranada.blogspot.com.es/2015/08/rose.html). And
also some pieces signed LJDA, *Los Jinetes del Apocalipsis*, the
Apocalipsis riders the first
collective created in the 90s and who are, still, active in some
special occasions.

You will have a good idea of what to expect everywhere else in the
city, but you will get a better idea if you proceed to the Faculty of
Fine Arts. This will have to be on a weekday; due to budget cuts all
the university is shuttered on weekends. Walk through the main gate
through the roundabout and, forgetting about temporary expositions and
cheap writing material which you should have checked out on its own
chapter, make a right until you arrive to the big warehouse. You will
already see graffiti from there: all that area is a showcase of
graffiti made by Fine Arts students and by writers from elsewhere. And
this is something that sets the graffiti scene in Granada apart from
others: at its core there is a certain academic knowledge, but also
the networks and communities that are created in this academic
setting, as opposed to other scenes that coalesce around a particular
neighborhood, the music of political activism scene. In fact, a
Faculty of Fine Arts includes all of them: many stencils in town have
been created as art projects by the students, and the fact that
pieces, and not other kind of graffiti, are so prevalent in Granada is
related to the formal studies that many of them have followed. You
need an idea of composition, color, theme and many other things to
create a piece, something that is not really needed to tag a wall or
even to create a complex wild-style signature.

Many graffiti writers have studied there; many writers from elsewhere
have at least followed a few courses here and, obversely, some
students have dabbled with street art at least as a drunken caper some
time in their life. Or maybe they have just worked in this extensive
graffiti farm, where you see all kind of things: from *jams* created
by several artists with aquatic motifs, to a utility closet fully decorated, to areas
overgrown with weeds and with graffiti that have been overwritten with
jokes by someone else. Also a wall decorated with representations of 1
euro coins. A black and red stencil with Darth Vader on a Holy Week
float says "I am your father". Close to the wall, another utility has
a shadow of a person smoking that seems to look at the rest of the
graffiti imprinted in the same place. A bit to the right a squid holds
a bleeding heart and says "squid love". And to the right of that,
"Graffiti cannot be learned in class".

That might be true, but maybe the class as a collective spawns
graffiti writers and helps them find their voice. That is interesting
about this area: many graffiti writers cannot be found anywhere else
in the city, or maybe in the world. Or, if you find them, they will
have evolved to something different, probably better. 

But let us travel to another place to check out the secret origins of
graffiti in Granada. And you will have to take a ride or a bus to the
other tip of the city to find out a
bit more about them. In fact, you could follow the freeway for around
fifteen kilometers, but it is better if you take a couple of buses and
go to the Nuevo Los Cármenes stadium. Then look South, in the
direction of the freeway, and will see a mostly dry river.

>That is the river Monachil, the third river in town and the one where
>90% of the locals who you ask will fail.

Follow the river bed to get under the bridge where the motorway
crosses it. You will find a *jam* that was created in the tenth
anniversary of the creation of LJDA. You cannot get more out of the
beaten track than that. There is fact no track, just the compacted
river bed. An gorgeous graffiti depicting the four horsemen and the
inscription LJDA 10th anniversary. It was painted in 2006, and
celebrates 10 years of creativity, generosity and chaos.

*Sex*-Raúl-Niño de las Pinturas himself tells, in an interview in *Escenas del graffiti en
 Granada*, how LJDA were born on a rainy Holy Week day in 1996 by
 Juxa, Mobil, Shogun, Calahad and himself, putting to good use 200
 sprays they brought, by bus, from Düsseldorf the day before. The
 first wall was painted in Cervantes avenue. That wall has
 disappeared, and I have not been able to find anything about it, so
 it is not worth the while that you walk there, but it is interesting
 to check out Yerma street.

>Yerma is the name of a play by Federico García Lorca. Meaning laid to
>waste or infertile, it is metaphorically applied to a woman. And it
>is a paradox that this street spawned such a fertile art.

This street is where Calahad and Sex lived in the early 90s, and is
covered in one of the sides by a brick wall. The first graffiti were
simple tags that read Sex or Calahad, and they were accompanied by
others, spirit, spit... The first pieces, already in 94, made by Spit
and others, already show the compressed evolution of the artistic
career that starts with a single black spray and a fast tag and
progresses to increasingly complex pieces, the state we are seeing
today.

>This street is very close to the Instituto de Astrofísica de
>Andalucía, one of the stops in the geek route. Besides, around the
>corner there is a graffiti wall with a astronomic theme. Check it out
>too. 

However, you will see only those twenty years old graffiti as parts of
the palimpsest that Yerma street is now. It is still painted, and some
pieces are quite old, but the piece by el Niño de las Pinturas that
celebrates the street itself is in the middle, it features a bar code
and black and white motifs. Just walk up and down and let the city
talk to you, and return later on to see what has happened. Graffiti
are alive, and sometimes writers *bomb* other writers by writing over
them, although there is a hierarchy of respect: pieces over wildstyle
over throwups over tags. And nobody, ever, will write over anything
done by El Niño de las Pinturas.

Walk down Camino Bajo de Huétor and you will get to the wall where the
inscription
["Ana Mari, do you want to watch Star Wars with me"](https://twitter.com/nlopeztrujillo/status/477370243921477632)
was written. It is the quintessential graffiti, and it also goes
across the lines of the geek culture that we love so much in
Granada. It
[went viral](https://www.google.es/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=%22%C2%BFAna+Mari+quieres+ver+Star+Wars+conmigo%3F%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=ld2QVrHkLPOs8weYj4fIAQ),
getting to a
[list of the 17 best ways to say "I love you" in a wall](http://verne.elpais.com/verne/2015/10/07/articulo/1444214555_993007.html?id_externo_rsoc=FB_CM). It
eventually disappeared, being the wall of a private home and not a
construction site or some official place. Love is forever, but
declarations are, and maybe should be, ephemeral.

From there, you can walk straight ahead to the wall of the Escolapios
school, in the [Callejón del Pretorio](https://www.google.es/maps/search/pretorio/@37.1679218,-3.593479,3a,75y,225.18h,86.11t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sSzMRlWpsrz_Orgkea6e4_A!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DSzMRlWpsrz_Orgkea6e4_A%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D79.0293%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=es).

This wall contains one of the oldest graffiti that still exist in
Granada. Some parts of it were created in 1993, a graffiti called
"Dragons" and drawn by Spirit and Chapas, but painting continued
in the next year and, even today, the wall is completely covered with
beautiful pieces and wild-style tags, although probably none of the
originals persist; they are just tiny layers of color in the surface
of the wall. This wall might be a result of a technique that graffiti
writers mentioned and that might have been used elsewhere: drop
*bombs* on a wall and make it ugly, do it by night and
unnoticed. Later on, when that wears and the wall looks like a
showcase of urban decay, talk to the owner and ask for permission to
do a beautiful piece, which you do.

This piece is, in fact, beautiful, and current instance includes Sex,
Nake and many others, including Drew. But the part I like the most is
more or less in the middle and uses the *trompe l'oeil* technique to
simulate a chasm opening in the wall with a figure with elongated arms
grabbing another graffiti to avoid falling. Its tag, RNDS or RNOS, is
completely unknown, but the signatures to the right, Sex, [Rakis](http://pintandogranada.blogspot.com.es/2015/08/rakis.html) and
even LJDA again are still there. [Rakis](https://myspace.com/rakisljda/photos) was born in Düsseldorf and was
the one in charge of bringing sprays to the whole LJDA crew. He
continues
[collaborating to this day](http://veronicasotosanchez.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/pajaureo-con-sex-y-rakis-ogijares.html),
with his wildsyle signatures that blend with the beautiful pieces by
Sex.
