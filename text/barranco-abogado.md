#Lawyer's Creek

It definitely looks like the name of an Old West settlement and, as a
matter of fact, it is
[an English accident](https://www.google.com/maps/place/52%C2%B052'59.9%22N+0%C2%B004'59.9%22E/@52.8833,-0.9672675,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en-US)
somewhere in the East Coast, but there is such as thing as El Barranco
del Abogado, literally Lawyer's Creek, a neighborhood that has nothing going for it. There are
no shops, just a bar, tongue-in-cheek called Bar Ranco, a
[single hotel that goes by the weird name Arabeluj](https://www.google.com/maps/place/52%C2%B052'59.9%22N+0%C2%B004'59.9%22E/@52.8833,-0.9672675,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en-US) 
that bills itself as being 5 minutes away from the city center, which
might happen if you roll downhill or if you step out of it at the very
moment the [C5 bus](http://www.movilidadgranada.com/bus_linea.php?idioma=es&linea=C4) is closing its doors to continue its trip and not
much else. That is why it is probably the most off-the-beaten track
neighborhood in Granada, so much so that it does not even have a
single entry in "Unusual and Secret Granada", the book that deals with
things here that are, well, unusual and secret; apparently a few years
ago a thinking head in the town hall decided to add value to the place
and
[published a leaflet](http://www.granada.es/inet/wprensa.nsf/bd57de750e6cf822c12573e5003e6725/b1fd39e17d0331fec12579c3004a7691!OpenDocument). What
has happened to aforementioned leaflet, nobody knows. I have not been
able to find even a PDF. 

Having its origins in cave dwellings, the same as the Sacromonte, it
is not unexpected that it became, when eventually coalesced, a down and out neighborhood, that,
in fact, did not have
[running water until well into the 21st century](http://www.ideal.es/granada/v/20110913/granada/barranco-abogado-granada-data-20110913.html). One
of its few monuments is a fountain built by a
[person of Dutch origin, Humberto Meersmans](http://lugaresdegranada.blogspot.com.es/2014/09/campo-de-los-martires.html),
same guy who owned the Carmen de los Mártires until he went bankrupt a
few years later and had to sell it. In fact, the Carmen is right on
top of the Barranco, so maybe he just fell pity for the people living
in its literal shadow and that had to tap the *acequia* or walk down
to the river to get their water. Or maybe go to the *Acequia del
Cadí*, an aqueduct bringing water to factories and fields downstream,
which was in the extreme of this quarter, which has had water, as a
big part of Granada, as a defining element. 

In the case of the Barranco it is rather a limit. It is limited, at
the beginning of the slope, by a water mill that belonged to the
family of Ángel Ganivet, a guy with Granada in its heart, so much so
that he froze it, along the rest of his body, diving into the Dvina,
where he was consul. That mill is worth a visit, if only because
nobody ever does so and the persons working there will be extremely
happy to talk to other, newfound, human beings. But it is around that
mill where you can start your visit if you love walking uphill. Going
up the staircase you will find a derelict house entirely painted by El
Niño de las Pinturas, right by the side of the Joe Strummer square and
another wholly painted house, surrounded by quirky art, which belongs
to none other than El Niño himself, so this is the center where all
his art irradiates. The density of graffiti in this area is just
overwhelming, and you will continue up the Barranco del Abogado street
seeing more stencils, graffiti, and all kind of street art, if only
because there is not much else to see. They are stone paved  with
little traffic, because the street ends in a small staircase
again. You will arrive to a paved street, Camino Nuevo del Cementerio,
or New Cemetery road, because as the crow or other appropriately
macabre bird flies, you are just a few hundred meters away from the graveyard.

>And I am getting already into other two chapters which you could read
>too, the one about graffiti and the one that deals with the
>cementery.

Walk right in that street to find other curious feature of this place:
the Virgin of Lourdes Sanctuary. Why a Virgin of French origin has a
place here, I would pressed hard to say. Maybe there was a cave, that
one was found in a cave, you join the dots. I have always found that
sanctuary rather decayed and utterly lonely. The surroundings of
decayed building and prickly pears, as well as the only hotel in the
quarter, give it an eerie feeling. 

>The "haunted" house that looks like an UFO is also very close. That
>one you should not miss, together with the chapter that deal with it.

You can go back to the main street or wander around for a while in
streets where people seem to have their very own *patio*. You will
enter some dead alleys where people have set couches, drying lines,
and are out there watching time go by. You will hear, more so when you
arrive to the cusp of the hill, where real farms, lemond and all kind
of groves are actually tended by real people. That is not all. 

When you get to the road to the Alhambra, take a hard turn left and go
through the olive grove. You heard that correctly, there is an olive
grove if not in the middle of the city, totally surrounded by it. A
gazebo to the left will give you an impressive sight, but further
ahead the walls of the Carmen de los Mártires will make you go down
some steps to find the lines waiting to get into the Alhambra. 

That is one of the privileges of that place that has yet to be
gentrified, although it will probably never be. Which makes walking up
and down its stairs, sitting idly by the Dutch fountain, or eating al
fresco in the gazebo from where you can see Granada and the Alhambra,
a privilege just for you and maybe other, like you, who have read this
book.
