# Tips for walking the city

In fact, these are tips that you can follow in any city of the world,
but that will endow you with a certain gaze that will allow you to
enjoy, read and understand the city, this city, any city, in new ways. And I put them in no
particular order. 

* Look up. The details of the city are hidden in rooftops, chimneys,
  steeples, open windows and balconies. Hopper was inspired by what he
  saw from the elevated train he rode in New York, you can be inspired
  by flying, and sometimes shitting, pigeons, baroque street lights or boots hanging from a
  wire. 

* Wander around. Never go from A to B following the shortest
  route. Blindly get into blind alleys. Check out passages. Stop by shop
  windows. Turn your fear of missing out into desire to explore
  everything. 

* Crowds are a magnet. However, they can either attract or
  repel. Follow crowds to see where stuff is happening. Avoid crowds
  for that unknown alley, right beside the main drag, where city life
  is actually taking place. 

* Do not let anyone schedule you. Streets do not close for the night, and
  any city, anywhere, lives twenty four hours each and every day. Walk
  the quiet city at 4 AM and check out night owls and party-goers. 3PM
  in August might melt you straight away, but might give you the
  cooler part of town, where draft beers have to be downed at the
  speed of the golden light of the sun, which is even more gilded as it goes
  through the bubbling lager. 

* Use your other senses. Listen to birds, rustling of leaves, the
  music of people talking. Smell the air, the flowers at dusk, the
  scent of varnish in a carpenter shop. Taste water, and beer, and
  local wines. Touch the stone, feel the fabric, poke the walls. 

* Do not hide behind a camera, but do not stop using it. When I visit
  a city for a few days, I come back with a thousand pictures. They
  help me remember what I did, and are a much better record of what I
  did there. And turn on geolocation in the device you are using for
  snapping pictures, they will help you even more to check what you
  did and when. 

* There is a *me* in *time*. Traveling in company is great. But
  schedules have to be matched, preferences agreed, rhythms
  fitted. However, you do not have to do that 100% of the time. Wander
  around solo and you will be able to schedule yourself, put all your
  senses on what you are doing and stop for a picture, or one hundred,
  wherever and whenever you want. It might get lonely at lunchtime or you might
  want to share a beer with someone, but spontaneous and ephemeral
  friendships might be the best ones. And, as you will see in this
  book, whatever is ephemeral remains, while the permanent things
  decay and disappear.

These are some of the principles that I have followed visiting this
one, which is my own, and other cities. May they help you to find
yourself somewhere else.
