# Tips for walking the city

In fact, these are tips that you can follow in any city of the world, but that will endow you with a certain gaze that will allow you to enjoy, read and understand the city in new ways. And I put them in no particular order.

* Look up. The details of the city are hidden in rooftops, chimneys, steeples, open windows and balconies. Hopper was inspired by what he saw from the elevated train he rode in New York, you can be inspired by flying pidgeons, baroque street lights or boots hanging from a wire.

* Wander around. Never go from A to B following the shortest route. Get into alleys. Check out passages. Stop by shop windows. Turn your fear of missing out into desire to explore everything.

* Crowds are a magnet. However, they can either attract or repel. Follow crowds to see where stuff is happening. Avoid crowds for that unknown alley, right beside the main drag, where city life is actually taking place.

* Do not let anyone schedule you. Streets are not closed at nigt, and any city, anywhere, lives twenty four hours each and every day. Walk the quiet city at 4 AM and check out night owls and party-goers. 3PM in August might melt you straight away, but might give you the cooler part of town, where draft beers have to be downed at the speed of the golden light of the sun goldened even more as it goes through the bubbling lager.

These are some of the principles that I have followed visiting my own, and other cities. May they help you to find yourself somewhere else.
