#The art of the roundabouts.

A roundabout is a convenient way of distributing traffic among three
or more roads, right? Wrong. In Spain, roundabouts have been elevated
to art. First, because of roundabouts themselves. They are the way a
major of a small city is telling the rest of the world, hey, check
this out, this is an important place. It is so very important that we
need this roundabout to distribute traffic. No more cars stopped in
the middle of the roads with none, sometimes one, car waiting behind
to go to important and nice places. Now *all* cars will have to either
yield to none or one car or anyway brake and take a small detour and
they will have MORE time to contemplate our beautiful city! Plus it
will give a job to my cousin, a hard working guy, but unfortunately
unemployed. And five or six other assorted citizens of this talented
and hard-working town.

You say roundabout, I say [pork barrel](http://www.cuatro.com/noticias/espana/rotondas-corrupcion-derroche-arquitectos-Nacion_Rotonda_2_1970880081.html). Roundabouts have reached such
proportions that some newspapers are looking for the
[ten ugliest roundabouts in Spain](http://blogs.publico.es/strambotic/2014/04/rotondismo/),
and it was hard work, there is even a full
[website](http://www.nacionrotonda.com/) devoted to them, comparing
the situation before adn after. The article above there are 23000
roundabouts in Spain. Fortunately, we have quite a few in Granada.

In order to enjoy them fully, the best examples are on the GR-3303
road which starts on the upper left corner of the Parque de las
Ciencias, between the Tico Medina park and the BMN buildings.
>I will have to write a chapter on these, too...

That road skims the outskirst of Granada, a dairy farm, and glorious
examples of the art of the roundabout. But the thing about roundabouts
is that once they are there, you cannot just let them become overgrown
week cupolas. You have to do *something*. That something is, almost
always, art. Also flags. In Spain we are fond of waving flags, and a
mast with a flag is something every major is as fond of as of letting
it there and not substituting even if it is now just a bunch of rags
stirred by air currents. But what flag, well, that is a conundrum. You
can pretty much know what political party is in power by looking at
the flag. If it is a Spanish flag, that is probably the Popular
Party. If it is not, well, it is any other party, but it
depends. Might be the regional flag, maybe the European flag, maybe
some other flag... You can see both in this roundabout tour. Or
*tourabout*, first one belonging to Churriana, second to Gabias. But
not only that. Art.

For instance,
[this sculpture](http://www.iu-churriana.es/2014/06/vicente-valero-pp-homenajea-las.html),
which is devoted to the victims of Franco, although you really have to
look hard, and stop there, to check that they are actually fingers and
not some strange mutant vegetable or creature from the underworld. But
after the tribute to victims of the dictatorship, what is left to
homage? Of course, the
[Seat 600](http://www.nidoarquitectura.es/proyectos-obra-singular/146-seat-600.html)
the car of the middle class during the self-same Franco years. But,
you know, cars produce CO2 and all that. Bad, bad for the
environment. So we will also give a tribute to
[trees](https://caperucitarojayunomas.wordpress.com/tag/rotondas-de-churriana-de-la-vega/). There
is no concentration of bizarre roundabouts anywhere else in the
country.

Plus if you go a bit further away, to AlhendÃ­n, you can see a very
small roundabout, with a bit of probably brown grass in it, that
[needed 14 politicians to be inaugurated](http://granadablogs.com/rumores/2013/10/14/la-rotonda-de-los-14-politicos/). That
was an absolute record, even for Spain. Or even in Granada, where
there is a
[helicopter in a roundabout](http://www.elindependientedegranada.es/indenews/ordenan-desahucio-okupa-que-vive-helicoptero-rotonda),
between the road to Armilla and Camino Ronda; you can visit it right
before taking the road. You say helicopter, I say hobo dwelling:
someone started to live there and had to be ousted by the police. Hey,
you can not beat the views.
>Actually, that is fake. Not the helicopter. The squatter.

Remember next time you see *something* in the middle of a roundabout
in the suburbs of Granada. Do not ask What the heck is *that*?. The
answer is always *Art*.
