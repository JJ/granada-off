# Buskers 

Let's talk about buskers, street performers, mimes, flashmobs and
other stuff mainly happening outdoors, as in out there, in streets,
alleys and town plazas. 

You might or might not find them, or by the time you read this maybe
they have moved to some place sunnier and where their art is better
appreciated. But there are a few recurring remarkable characters some
of which I will include here for the only reason I have seen them and
liked them.

The first one is, actually, the one that has compelled me to write
this chapter. I met him for the first time with a big smile singing in
a strange language in front of the Varagua bar, right where the
*roman* bridge disembowels lots of people coming from the Zaidín, the
Escolapios school, the Mercadona, and, lately, the LAC. He was playing
an instrument that, at first sight, looked like a pregnant banjo but,
on second thought, was probably a
[*kora*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kora_%28instrument%29), which
made the person using it a *griot*, or, better, a *jali*. He seemed
immensely happy, smile and music not falling from his lips for the
whole time I was there, and his song seemed, at the same time, a happy
story but with a sad, lamenting, undercurrent.

>It is probably not a kora, but a
>[N'Goni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngoni_%28instrument%29). However,
>it is
>nearly impossible for me to make out the differences between them. 

Later on I watched
[*El ritmo de la calle* (The street beat)](http://www.asociacionprensa.org/es/noticias/noticias-de-comunicaci%C3%B3n/2844-el-documental-%E2%80%98al-ritmo-de-la-calle%E2%80%99-se-estrena-el-pr%C3%B3ximo-20-de-octubre-en-cinesur-nervi%C3%B3n-plaza.html),
where he is featured along with many other street musicians of all
kinds and origins. His name is Ibrahim Diakité, and he apparently
lives in Granada. In fact, I saw him again in the self same place, by
the end of November 2014, happily beating his kora and swinging his
spiky hair and foot to the rhythm of his music, by himself, almost, but
not quite, oblivious of the autumn that was settling him all around
him. And, if you happen to miss it, you can always watch him in
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmF8VT2y-0Q). Where
can you find him? It is difficult to say. Not the kind of job you do
nine to five in a fixed place, but according to my own experience and
videos found (like [this one](http://vimeo.com/83792239)) either in
Paseo de los Tristes, right in front of the Alhambra, or by the roman
bridge, at the beginning of el Paseo del Salón.

That is not an usual place for buskers, although it is quite usual to find umbrella and trinket peddlers there. You will have to move a few hundred of meters up, to Puerta Real or up the Carrera de las Angustias, which have become Busking Central. Of late not many musicians are there, but there are mimes galore. The one that seems to be suspended off a broomstick, the sad silver witch, and, sometimes, and that is not busking, the roast chestnut seller, and the Disney characters that sell balloons or maybe get paid for posing in pictures. The esplanade in front of the fountain is where you can find sometimes groups such as [Elsa Bhör](https://soundcloud.com/elsabhor). Puppets and string quartets set up their act by the left hand side of the Isabel la Católica, in the pedestrian lane that goes up to Ángel Ganivet, and if you keep walking up Reyes Católicos, you will arrive to Plaza Nueva, where big acts such as *batucadas* or even flamenco cry and dance in front of the many tourists that are there. They are probably the less authentic and more tourist-oriented acts, but they are worth a while anyway. Other groups like [El mundo del revés](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VAuV6GugKs) usually work their reggae tunes further down the street, in the Paseo de los Tristes. 

The problem is Granada is that we are fond of forbidding things. The mime is sad because she cannot mime. Begging is OK, miming is off-limits. So she puts her makeup every weekend but can just stand there, waving sad hellos or goodbyes and waiting for someone to drop an euro in her silver hat. [Music has been banished from the Albayzín](http://granadaimedia.com/musicos-callejeros-albaicin/), maybe because [too much of a good thing](http://www.granadablogs.com/juezcalatayud/2014/08/exceso-de-artistas-callejeros-en-el-barrio/) can be as bad as too little.

Like this chapter, that has been too much on the beaten track, since buskers ply their trade wherever crowds gather and can be parted with their spare change. However, it departs the beaten track of historic anecdote and old stones to focus on listening and watching people. People so ephemeral, that, as is so often said of Granada, they are permanent.
