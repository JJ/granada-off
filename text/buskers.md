# Buskers, street performers, mimes, flashmobs and other stuff mainly happening outdoors

You might or might not find them, or by the time you read this maybe
they've moved to some place sunnier and where their art is better
appreciated. But there are a few recurring remarkable characters some
of which I will include here for the only reason I have seen them and
liked them.

The first one is, actually, the one that has compelled me to write
this chapter. I met him for the first time with a big smile singing in
a strange language in front of the Varagua bar, right where the
*roman* bridge disembowels lots of people coming from the Zaidín, the
Escolapios school, the Mercadona, and, lately, the LAC. He was playing
an instrument that, at first sight, looked like a pregnant banjo but,
on second thought, was probably a
[*kora*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kora_%28instrument%29), which
made the person using it a *griot*, or, better, a *jali*. He seemed
immensely happy, smile and music not falling from his lips for the
whole time I was there, and his song seemed, at the same time, a happy
story but with a sad, lamenting, undercurrent.

>It is probably not a kora, but a
>[N'Goni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngoni_%28instrument%29). However,
>it is
>nearly impossible for me to make out the differences between them. 

Later on I watched
[*El ritmo de la calle* (The street beat)](http://www.asociacionprensa.org/es/noticias/noticias-de-comunicaci%C3%B3n/2844-el-documental-%E2%80%98al-ritmo-de-la-calle%E2%80%99-se-estrena-el-pr%C3%B3ximo-20-de-octubre-en-cinesur-nervi%C3%B3n-plaza.html),
where he is featured along with many other street musicians of all
kinds and origins. His name is Ibrahim Diakité, and he apparently
lives in Granada. In fact, I saw him again in the self same place, by
the end of November 2014, happily beating his kora and swinging his
spiky hair and foot to the rhythm of his music, by himself, almost, but
not quite, oblivious of the autumn that was settling him all around
him. And, if you happen to miss it, you can always watch him in
[this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmF8VT2y-0Q). Where
can you find him? It is difficult to say. Not the kind of job you do
nine to five in a fixed place, but according to my own experience and
videos found (like [this one](http://vimeo.com/83792239)) either in
Paseo de los Tristes, right in front of the Alhambra, or by the roman
bridge, at the beginning of el Paseo del Salón.
