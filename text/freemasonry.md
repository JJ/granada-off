#Freemasonry in Granada

For those in the know, Granada itself is a symbol of freemasonry. Its main symbol is a pomegranate, *granada* in Spanish, a fruit that can be found all over the city. At the beginning of the Paseo del Salón there is a pomegranate fountain, bollards are capped by huge pomegranates, and in a roundabout that dots the incoming road from Jaén, a huge pomegranate greets the visitor.

>That roundabout is the intersection of other two chapters, the one about roundabouts and the one about whorehouses and other sex-trading places. And now this one. Actually, it is going to become the keystone to the whole city.

Thus, bollards in Granada share the caps with the [columns of the temple of Solomon](http://www.masonicdictionary.com/pomegranate.html) mentioned in the masonic literature. Pomegranates are a [symbol of fertility all over the world](http://www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/Symbolism/comprehensive_files/short_symbolism/pomegranates.htm), and explained in the lectures for the second masonic degree, being a symbol for the mason himself, since it has got a tough skin but an indulgent interior, every seed a symbol for the masons and the whole pomegranate a symbol for the order, and many other different meanings.

The pomegranate symbol is also in the coat of arms of Granada and,
through it, in the Spanish one. It shares the pomegranate with
[Colombia, which was part of what was initially called Nueva Granada](http://aperiresecreta.blogspot.com.es/2015/06/colombianopoly-el-poder-de-la-masoneria.html)
but where the symbol is also acknowledged as having a masonic origin,
with their first president, Francisco de Paula Santander, being
himself a freemason.

Identifying the seal of freemasonry every time we find a pomegranate
in Granada would, however, take things a bit too far. First, because they all over the place: in rain gutters, in sewer hatches, in all kinds of company logos, even in stencils in walls. Second, because the symbol was
already there when the Catholic Kings took Granada in the XV century,
and, in fact, put a pomegranate in the coat of arms of Spain; if you
think that makes the old guys remiss of freemasonry, you would be so
very wrong. 
We would have to look for it by itself, in a place which
was not official or built officially, or in conjunction with other
symbols. There is one, for instance, in the middle of the Antequeruela
neighborhood, in the Calle Paredón Jesús de las Penas, up in a corner, for no reason. Although it is actually in a *cornerstone*, which [freemasons lay out publicly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone#Freemasonry). So one can imagine these guys all dressed up laying the cornerstone, and so as to drive the message home clearly, putting a discrete pomegranate, instead of a less discrete triangle or compass, on it. And this is not the only candidate: 
Check it out also in Paseo de los Tristes number 63, with pomegranates in the cusps of a elongated pyramid, another masonic symbol.

The symbology is quite clear, however, in
[the Ladrón de Agua hotel](http://www.ladrondeagua.com/legacy/), a bit
further down the street in the Paseo de los Tristes, close to Plaza
Nueva. Besides an advocation to Mithra, "Deo Soli Invicto Mithre", to
the unbeaten sun-god Mithra, and a representation of him fighting
against a
[lion, a symbol of a masonic candidate](http://ezinearticles.com/?Masonic-Symbolism-Book---Grip-Of-The-Lions-Paw&id=4871957),
the symbols painted at the left hand side of the wall are quite clear:
an old sage holds an armillary sphere in one hand, a symbol of
knowledge, and a compass in the other hand. This compass hovers over a
parchment with a triangle, the masonic symbol for the all-seeing
eye. While in other cases, notably in the case of the
pomegranate-in-the-cornerstone, we might have some doubt on whether
this is actually related to freemasons at all, it is well known the
masonic affiliation of the owner of the house, Nicolás Fajardo, and in fact,
[the application for initiation in the Reforma nr. 75 Lodge](http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/pdf.raw?query=parent%3A0003374779+type%3Apress%2Fpage&name=Bolet%C3%ADn+oficial+del+Gran+Oriente+Espa%C3%B1ol.+1-1-1890)
is published in the bulletin number 13, dated January the
first, 1890. This lodge was apparently
[expensive](https://books.google.es/books?id=jufWVxJrcqcC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=logia+reforma+75&source=bl&ots=yleW56cyaI&sig=m0VMGJXnDubIvU_VprJVRERw_2c&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwvJeb75TKAhXG1RoKHc_dBesQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&q=logia%20reforma%2075&f=false)
and thus reserved to persons of a certain economic level, which might
or not explain why this
[lodge was one of the first to ask for admission of women, even a few years before that](http://gredos.usal.es/jspui/bitstream/10366/80189/1/La_integracion_de_las_mujeres_en_la_maso.pdf). That
lodge also included
[Anselmo Arenas](http://www.aache.com/alcarrians/arenas_lopez.htm), a
geography professor at the university of Granada whose teaching were
suppressed because they clashed with the catholic doctrine. So all was
not good and well for the heterodoxy, and freemasons had good reasons to hide, or at
least not be extremely open about their ideas. Although the house is
quite old, from the XVI century, it was bought by Nicolás in the
1920s; he commissioned his own son, Nicolás Fajardo Vílchez, to carry
them out and, in fact, they are a copy of older paintings found in the
backyard of the 
["Casa del padre Eterno", or "Eternal father house", which belonged to
the same family](http://nito-lamurga.blogspot.com.es/2013/07/la-casa-de-mitra-h-oy-traemos-la.html). This
decoration is much older, from the XVI century, in the classic
tradition which has nothing to do with the modernist fashion that used
to be the rage in those days in Spain. This house still exists and is
now a luxury hotel. Nothing remains of this original
fresco, which would have been nice, since popular tradition said that
the representation of the Eternal Father was looking at a place where
a treasure was buried.

>It is now looking at the crowds that break open to let the touristic
>train pass. So, in this case the beaten track is just a metaphor for
>looking at different things, or the same things in a different way,
>because that particular has track has been beat to exhaustion.

This means that the only way to contemplate them is to look at the
copy. Copy and paste saves the day, for once. 


It is difficult to find more of them. Freemasonry was very actively repressed during Franco's dictatorship in Granada, with masons arrested and shot just for that reason. This does not imply that masonic symbols or houses with them were razed; in most cases they were not recognized as such, but maybe they simply disappeared after the home owners were exiled or killed. That is why one of the remaining masonic symbols come from way before that, from 1595: [a symbol in the cross in front of the Sacromonte monastery](http://www.heraldaria.com/phorum5/read.php?3,6883,6901). A legend inscribed in the cross references Solomon's temple and were made by the stonemasons, whose guilds were, apparently, the origin of freemasonry here in Spain and in many other places.


There is a twist to this history of Granada equal to freemasonry. I
remember to have seen in Santa Fe, NM, its name itself taken from the
city of Santa Fé, close to Granada, a red building with Moorish
features, in fact in the so called "Moorish revival" style, which is, 
[quote, "based loosely on one of the gatehouses to the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra in Spain"](http://aasrnys.blogspot.com.es/). There
are
also some
[knights of the Alhambra](http://www.angelfire.com/weird2/obscure2/cath.html)
which are part of the Shriners, an order of Catholic Masonry.

Alhambra was, precisely, one of the
[historic lodges in the city](http://www.logiaginerdelosrios.es/historia-de-la-masoneria/),
housed in what is now known as Hotel del Reúma. 

>And which has received attention in the chapter on haunted mansions,
>which I encourage you to visit right now.

That was the lodge where Federico García Lorca was apparently
initiated.
