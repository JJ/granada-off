#Freemasonry in Granada

For those in the know, Granada itself is a symbol of freemasonry. Its main symbol is a pomegranate, *granada* in Spanish, a fruit that can be found all over the city. At the beginning of the Paseo del Salón there is a pomegranate fountain, bollards are capped by huge pomegranates, and in a roundabout that dots the incoming road from Jaén, a huge pomegranate greets the visitor.

>That roundabout is the intersection of other two chapters, the one about roundabouts and the one about whorehouses and other sex-trading places. And now this one. Actually, it is going to become the keystone to the whole city.

Thus, bollards in Granada share the caps with the [columns of the temple of Solomon](http://www.masonicdictionary.com/pomegranate.html) mentioned in the masonic literature. Pomegranates are a [symbol of fertility all over the world](http://www.themasonictrowel.com/Articles/Symbolism/comprehensive_files/short_symbolism/pomegranates.htm), and explained in the lectures for the second masonic degree, being a symbol for the mason himself, since it has got a tough skin but an indulgent interior, every seed a symbol for the masons and the whole pomegranate a symbol for the order, and many other different meanings.

The pomegranate symbol is also in the coat of arms of Granada and,
through it, in the Spanish one. It shares the pomegranate with
[Colombia, which was part of what was initially called Nueva Granada](http://aperiresecreta.blogspot.com.es/2015/06/colombianopoly-el-poder-de-la-masoneria.html)
but where the symbol is also acknowledged as having a masonic origin,
with their first president, Francisco de Paula Santander, being
himself a freemason.

Identifying the seal of freemasonry every time we find a pomegranate
in Granada would, however, take things a bit too far. The symbol was
already there when the Catholic Kings took Granada in the XV century,
and, in fact, put a pomegranate in the coat of arms of Spain; if you
think that makes the old guys remiss of freemasonry, you would be so
very wrong. We would have to look for it by itself, in a place which
was not official or built officially, or in conjunction with other
symbols. There is one, for instance, in the middle of the Antequeruela
neighborhood, up in a corner, for no reason.

There is a twist to this history of Granada equal to freemasonry. I
remember to have seen in Santa Fe, NM, its name itself taken from the
city of Santa Fé, close to Granada, a red building with Moorish
features, in fact in the so called "Moorish revival" style, which is
["based loosely on one of the gatehouses to the Court of the Lions at
the Alhambra in Spain"](http://aasrnys.blogspot.com.es/). There are
also some
[knights of the Alhambra](http://www.angelfire.com/weird2/obscure2/cath.html)
which are part of the Shriners, an order of Catholic Masonry.
