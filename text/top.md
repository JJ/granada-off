# Top places and things to do.

No touristy book would be complete without a list of top places or activities or things like that. Here it goes.

## Top cheesecake

"La mamá de Cris" has the greatest cheesecake in town, if not one of the best in the country. It's a small place to taste in onsite, but you can buy it and take it home. Enjoy it with a bit of Oolong or Earl Grey tea.

## Top chocolate con churros

Everyone has got their own favorite chocolate with churros place.

> Everyone who lives or has lived in a certain area of Spain, that is.

It's the quintessential after-hours snack, the one you take when you've called a night and are going back home. There's probably one in every extended neighborhood in Granada, but one of the most typical is the café Fútbol, in Mariana Pineda square. It's open well into the night, and also early in the morning. Bear in mind that these churros are rather unlike the Mexican churros that you can eat most everywhere else: they're not sweet or filled with cream. If you take out the sugar coating and the filler, and make it around half the size, you've pretty much got it.
Maybe they're not filled, because they are usually taken with hot chocolate, dark and thick, dipping them there and taking them, real fast but not too fast, to your mouth trying to avoid sprinkling everyone with chocolate or the oil (olive oil, of course) they're made in.
