# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth [Parque de las Ciencias](Parque de las Ciencias), which is the subject of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, spending half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling herds of kids that abound there.

As you get out of the Parque de las Ciencias, you can proceed to the so-named "Rotonda del Helicóptero", or "Helicopter roundabout", which you cannot miss since there is a helicopter there, set up on a rotating axis that makes it look this and that way, depending on wind and ground vibration. It is placed on the way to the [Armilla air base, wing 78 of the Spanish Air Force](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=D7BBF2E4EBCB7EE6C12570DD00429F4B&idRef=1C4723CC4E4142DCC125745900266B6D), precisely the wing that flew it until not so long ago, well into this millenium. This is mainly a training wing but also houses the [patrulla ASPA](http://patrullaaspa.defensa.gob.es/es/index.html), a helicopter aerobatics team that features the new Eurocopter, one of just half a dozen in the world. However, there are only a few scheduled acts if you want to watch them. 

>I remember to spend the time of boring classes during the 80s watching the Bucker 131 biplanes sputtering in the sky, in front of the Facultad de Ciencias. They were true relics of the 20s, and probably the ones that were used to train by current fighter pilots in the Spanish air force.

That helicopter is an [Sikorsky S-76C Spirit or HE24 in SpAF denomination](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=CF3470AF935F8396C12570D700464251&idRef=F28FEDE5105891C6C12576350030E54B), was acquired in 1991 and used mainly for instrumental training in the wing, although it could be used also for ferrying people or rescue missions. It is one of the [most modern helos in the SpAF](http://www.ala78virtual.es/contenidos/flota.htm), so I do not really understand what is the deal with it. Maybe it was originally bought second hand or something. You can see it in action in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fvo2hnYzu4) and check its former locations in [this helospotters database](http://www.helis.com/database/cn/3517/)

>Last annotation is mine, I guess. It did not mention it was retired from service.

Actually, the previous location was the aforementioned Parque de las Ciencias, where apparently went after [the engine broke, according to a tweet](https://twitter.com/WanManolo/status/681797531421007872). And it was placed there to celebrate the centennial of aviation in Spain. Curiously enough, the plane was called S-76 to celebrate the *bicentennial* of the US. So, two centennials in a single decorated roundabout. This helicopter has also got a much [geekier version, the S-76 Shadow](http://www.kamov.net/general-aviation/s-76-shadow/), with an awkward-looking but coolly operated through a Heads-Up Display front-mounted single-pilot cabin. And that is a sentence with a lot of dashes. 

>More about roundabouts in its very own chapter.

If you are into big machines, walk from that roundabout, or take the LAC, and go to the end of Paseo de la Bomba. Despite its name, which might or might not be due to a bomb falling there in the civil war or maybe to the fact that there was a big pump for the *Acequia Gorda*, or big irrigation ditch or maybe to the [fountain at the beginning which doest not look at all like a bomb](http://1000-reinogranada.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/fuente-de-los-cuatro-leones.html); *bomba* means either *bomb* or *pump* in Spanish, and the big machine is the roundabout could be a steam-operated pump, but is actually a press belonging to a sugar-producing *ingenio* or "engine", which is what sugar mills were called at the beginning of the Century, when high sugar prices brought unknown wealth to many countries and regions in the world, including Granada. This machine, along with the modernist mansions in the city center and the Gran Vía, are testimony of that era [when Granada depended on a different monoculture](http://granadapedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Historia_de_la_ca%C3%B1a_de_az%C3%BAcar). In this case, this machine was part of the *azucarera* San José, which was placed exactly, or rather pretty much, in this place, maybe a bit North of that, since to the South-West, where there is a wood-paneled building now, there was a tram depot. That was the tram that went up to the Sierra, and which was dismantled in the 70s.
