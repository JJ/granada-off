# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth [Parque de las Ciencias](Parque de las Ciencias), which is the subject of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, spending half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling herds of kids that abound there.

As you get out of the Parque de las Ciencias, you can proceed to the so-named "Rotonda del Helicóptero", or "Helicopter roundabout", which you cannot miss since there is a helicopter there, set up on a rotating axis that makes it look this and that way, depending on wind and ground vibration. It is placed on the way to the [Armilla air base, wing 78 of the Spanish Air Force](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=D7BBF2E4EBCB7EE6C12570DD00429F4B&idRef=1C4723CC4E4142DCC125745900266B6D), precisely the wing that flew it until not so long ago, well into this millenium. This is mainly a training wing but also houses the [patrulla ASPA](http://patrullaaspa.defensa.gob.es/es/index.html), a helicopter aerobatics team that features the new Eurocopter, one of just half a dozen in the world. However, there are only a few scheduled acts if you want to watch them. 

>I remember to spend the time of boring classes during the 80s watching the Bucker 131 biplanes sputtering in the sky, in front of the Facultad de Ciencias. They were true relics of the 20s, and probably the ones that were used to train by current fighter pilots in the Spanish air force.

That helicopter is an [Sikorsky S-76C Spirit or HE24 in SpAF denomination](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=CF3470AF935F8396C12570D700464251&idRef=F28FEDE5105891C6C12576350030E54B), was acquired in 1991 and used mainly for instrumental training in the wing, although it could be used also for ferrying people or rescue missions. It is one of the [most modern helos in the SpAF](http://www.ala78virtual.es/contenidos/flota.htm), so I do not really understand what is the deal with it. Maybe it was originally bought second hand or something. You can see it in action in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fvo2hnYzu4) and check its former locations in [this helospotters database](http://www.helis.com/database/cn/3517/)

>Last annotation is mine, I guess. It did not mention it was retired from service.

Actually, the previous location was the aforementioned Parque de las Ciencias, where apparently went after [the engine broke, according to a tweet](https://twitter.com/WanManolo/status/681797531421007872). And it was placed there to celebrate the centennial of aviation in Spain. Curiously enough, the plane was called S-76 to celebrate the *bicentennial* of the US. So, two centennials in a single decorated roundabout. This helicopter has also got a much [geekier version, the S-76 Shadow](http://www.kamov.net/general-aviation/s-76-shadow/), with an awkward-looking but coolly operated through a Heads-Up Display front-mounted single-pilot cabin. And that is a sentence with a lot of dashes. 

>More about roundabouts in its very own chapter.

If you are into big machines, walk from that roundabout, or take the LAC, and go to the end of Paseo de la Bomba. Despite its name, which might or might not be due to a bomb falling there in the civil war or maybe to the fact that there was a big pump for the *Acequia Gorda*, or big irrigation ditch or maybe to the [fountain at the beginning which doest not look at all like a bomb](http://1000-reinogranada.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/fuente-de-los-cuatro-leones.html); *bomba* means either *bomb* or *pump* in Spanish, and the big machine is the roundabout could be a steam-operated pump, but is actually a press belonging to a sugar-producing *ingenio* or "engine", which is what sugar mills were called at the beginning of the Century, when high sugar prices brought unknown wealth to many countries and regions in the world, including Granada. This machine, along with the modernist mansions in the city center and the Gran Vía, are testimony of that era [when Granada depended on a different monoculture](http://granadapedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Historia_de_la_ca%C3%B1a_de_az%C3%BAcar). In this case, this machine was part of the *azucarera* San José, which was placed exactly, or rather pretty much, in this place, maybe a bit North of that, since to the South-West, where there is a wood-paneled building now, there was a tram depot. That was the tram that made the trip to the Sierra, and which was dismantled in the 70s.

That tram was, for some time, placed in la [Facultad de Ciencias, or Faculty of Sciences, of the University of Granada](http://fciencias.ugr.es/en/). It might or might not be there by the time you read this, since it was taken for restoration and has not returned. However, there is another steam engine parked there and you can always check [the building itself](http://patrimonio3d.ugr.es/index.php/granada/edificios/item/60-facultad-de-ciencias), which was projected and built in the sixties although it has had lots of additions. There is some fodder for geeks inside the building, where all kind of sciences, from Physics to Geology, are studied. To the right hand side, the Physics building houses a Foucault pendulum, and going from there to the main building, the library to the right hand side houses scientific journals from early on, the fifties and even before that. I have spent there a good part of my studies in the eighties, and I was elated to find an article by Einstein himself, published in the fifties in some Physics journal. Quite an interesting, if a bit over the top of my head, reading.

The main hall has all kind of widgets: rockets, other engines, maybe some other temporary exhibitions,  and, from there on, the biology building has a rather creepy stuffed animals vitrine, and the geology departments all kind of rocks. There is nothing but people in the Maths area, and in the Chemistry little but pungent smells.

If you go across the parking to the next building and ask nicely, you might be able to visit [Alhambra, our very own supercomputer](http://alhambra.ugr.es/), which is not open to the public but there will probably be someone proud enough in [computing services of the University](http://csirc.ugr.es) to show it to you. That is the precise building where the ur-geeks of the eighties spent our time, because it housed the first computer lab, filled with IBM XTs, and where you had to dress nicely, no shorts, if you did not want to be expelled by the janitors. This building housed the university mainframes for some time, and it still has a big data center.

If you want to see one of those computers, you will have to catch the SN3 bus to the [ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es), which is a geek place if there is one in Granada. You cannot miss the stop: where the nerd-looking guys get down, that is the place

>It is by a park, just in case there is a nerd glut the particular moment you ride the bus and they stop somewhere else.

The main hall is graced by a big IBM mainframe, together with all its peripherals: disk drum, data entry console, all the rest. But it did not belong to the University, but to some pioneering computing company in Granada called *Centro de Cálculo de Granada*, which has completely vanished.

Then, walk up two floors to the Department of [Computer Technology and Architecture](http://atc.ugr.es),

>Once you are there, go to the next to last office on the right on the corridor to your left, you might recognize the name of the person there, and if he is in, he will happily sign your copy of this book, or your Kindle or other reading device. Appointment not necessary. 

To the right of the entrance door there is a vitrine with the history of computing as seen from the department. You can see there from *portable* computers from the early 90s, through all kind of peripherals, including a hand scanner that belonged to me, to chips that were designed from scratch in our very own department. All of it neither catalogued, nor labelled, nor acknowledged. We do not even know if it works or not, and it is closer to a storage closet than to a real museum. However, maybe some time from now, maybe even by the time you read this, someone with an interest in retro computing will use it for a master's degree project or a PhD. Or just out of spite, to give it a big of dignity.

When you get out of the building, you might want to visit the biggest data center in Andalucía, the [Cloud Center Andalucía](http://cca.trevenque.es/).

>Incidentally, you will go past one of the establishments we talked about in the chapter on whorehouses, the Don Pepe. None are too far, so using a pit stop as an excuse to be there is not an option.

You will not be able to see anything from outside, other than the ditch that connects it to the railway, a few meters away, where the fiber actually goes. But you can [request a visit](http://cca.trevenque.es/instalaciones/) and you will be able to see the watertight rooms where all the racks are stored, the firefighting measures, and the hum of twenty-first century computing all around you. Which is something all geeks love and crave.

>Visits are only available under requests, and then only for a good reason and in a group. So you might want to gather at least half a dozen of friends to do it, and request it well in advance.
