# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth [Parque de las Ciencias](Parque de las Ciencias), which is the subject of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, spending half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling herds of kids that abound there.

As you get out of the Parque de las Ciencias, you can proceed to the so-named "Rotonda del Helicóptero", or "Helicopter roundabout", which you cannot miss since there is a helicopter there, set up on a rotating axis that makes it look this and that way, depending on wind and ground vibration. It is placed on the way to the [Armilla air base, wing 78 of the Spanish Air Force](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=D7BBF2E4EBCB7EE6C12570DD00429F4B&idRef=1C4723CC4E4142DCC125745900266B6D), precisely the wing that flew it until not so long ago, well into this millenium. This is mainly a training wing but also houses the [patrulla ASPA](http://patrullaaspa.defensa.gob.es/es/index.html), a helicopter aerobatics team that features the new Eurocopter, one of just half a dozen in the world. However, there are only a few scheduled acts if you want to watch them. 

>I remember to spend the time of boring classes during the 80s watching the Bucker 131 biplanes sputtering in the sky, in front of the Facultad de Ciencias. They were true relics of the 20s, and probably the ones that were used to train by current fighter pilots in the Spanish air force.

That helicopter is an [Sikorsky S-76C Spirit or HE24 in SpAF denomination](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=CF3470AF935F8396C12570D700464251&idRef=F28FEDE5105891C6C12576350030E54B), was acquired in 1991 and used mainly for instrumental training in the wing, although it could be used also for ferrying people or rescue missions. It is one of the [most modern helos in the SpAF](http://www.ala78virtual.es/contenidos/flota.htm), so I do not really understand what is the deal with it. Maybe it was originally bought second hand or something. You can see it in action in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fvo2hnYzu4) and check its former locations in [this helospotters database](http://www.helis.com/database/cn/3517/)

>Last annotation is mine, I guess. The page did not mention it was retired from service.

Actually, the previous location was the aforementioned Parque de las Ciencias, where apparently went after [the engine broke, according to a tweet](https://twitter.com/WanManolo/status/681797531421007872). And it was placed there to celebrate the centennial of aviation in Spain. Curiously enough, the plane was called S-76 to celebrate the *bicentennial* of the US. So, two centennials in a single decorated roundabout. This helicopter has also got a much [geekier version, the S-76 Shadow](http://www.kamov.net/general-aviation/s-76-shadow/), with an awkward-looking but coolly operated through a Heads-Up Display front-mounted single-pilot cabin. And that is a sentence with a lot of dashes. 

>More about roundabouts in its very own chapter.

If you continue in the direction of the Avenida de América, past the
exit of the underground tunnel, where, who knows, you might even see a
train coming or going, past the nano-Manhattan by the end of that
avenue, with a couple of tall buildings, and then, when you arrive at
the bulevard with the frayed flags, take a left and you will arrive at
the
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA or Andalucían Astrophysics institute](http://iaa.es). You
cannot miss it, it is the one with the rocket protruding out of its
front garden. It
is quite an open place where you can pop in and ask someone about
[the Rosetta mission](http://rosetta.iaa.es/noticias) or about
exoplanets, since this institute includes discoverers of one of the
first ones. Instruments for spatial missions are created here, and
there are a few on display. The rocket, for instance. It is an
atmospheric research probe which was designed here and launched in the
eighties, starting
[our regional space race](http://www.ideal.es/granada/culturas/201511/22/nosotros-empezamos-carrera-espacial-20151114215419.html).

>In this interview, José Manuel Vílchez mentions Manuel Merlo Vallejo,
>a Jesuit that was in the origins of the current Institute. Another
>case of Jesuits going hand in hand with science in Granada. More on
>this on the chapter about the university. 

From there it is just a short stretch to the Paseo de la Bomba, which
you cannot miss if you are into big steam machines, or into steampunk.

>You might take a detour to check out the "haunted" hause not so far
>from there, described in the chapter on hauntings.

Despite its name, which might or might not be due to a bomb falling
there in the civil war or maybe to the fact that there was a big pump
for the *Acequia Gorda*, or big irrigation ditch or maybe to the
[fountain at the beginning which doest not look at all like a bomb](http://1000-reinogranada.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/fuente-de-los-cuatro-leones.html);
*bomba* means either *bomb* or *pump* in Spanish, and the big machine
is the roundabout could be a steam-operated pump, but is actually a
press belonging to a sugar-producing *ingenio* or "engine", which is
what sugar mills were called at the beginning of the Century, when
high sugar prices brought unknown wealth to many countries and regions
in the world, including Granada. The machine was produced in 1905 by
[Fives-Lille](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fives-Lille), a company
which was also in charge of building railways all along eastern
Andalucía and the lift inside the Eiffel Tower. Surprisinly, this company perdures to this very day, although under the
name of Fives. All steampunks should
know about this company, responsible for lots of iron bridges and
scary-looking machines in Andalucía. 

This machine, along with the modernist mansions in the city center and the Gran Vía, are testimony of that era [when Granada depended on a different monoculture](http://granadapedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Historia_de_la_ca%C3%B1a_de_az%C3%BAcar). In this case, this machine was part of the *azucarera* San José, which was placed exactly, or rather pretty much, in this place, maybe a bit North of that, since to the South-West, where there is a wood-paneled building now, there was a tram depot. That was the tram that made the trip to the Sierra, and which was dismantled in the 70s.

That tram was, for some time, placed in la [Facultad de Ciencias, or Faculty of Sciences, of the University of Granada](http://fciencias.ugr.es/en/). It might or might not be there by the time you read this, since it was taken for restoration and has not returned. However, there is another steam engine parked there and you can always check [the building itself](http://patrimonio3d.ugr.es/index.php/granada/edificios/item/60-facultad-de-ciencias), which was projected and built in the sixties although it has had lots of additions. There is some fodder for geeks inside the building, where all kind of sciences, from Physics to Geology, are studied. To the right hand side, the Physics building houses a Foucault pendulum, and going from there to the main building, the library to the right hand side houses scientific journals from early on, the fifties and even before that. I have spent there a good part of my studies in the eighties, and I was elated to find an article by Einstein himself, published in the fifties in some Physics journal. Quite an interesting, if a bit over the top of my head, reading.

The main hall has all kind of widgets: rockets, other engines, maybe some other temporary exhibitions,  and, from there on, the biology building has a rather creepy stuffed animals vitrine, and the geology departments all kind of rocks. There is nothing but people in the Maths area, and in the Chemistry little but pungent smells.

If you go across the parking to the next building and ask nicely, you might be able to visit [Alhambra, our very own supercomputer](http://alhambra.ugr.es/), which is not open to the public but there will probably be someone proud enough in [computing services of the University](http://csirc.ugr.es) to show it to you. That is the precise building where the ur-geeks of the eighties spent our time, because it housed the first computer lab, filled with IBM XTs, and where you had to dress nicely, no shorts, if you did not want to be expelled by the janitors. This building housed the university mainframes for some time, and it still has a big data center.

If you want to see one of those computers, you will have to catch the SN3 bus to the [ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es), which is a geek place if there is one in Granada. You cannot miss the stop: where the nerd-looking guys get down, that is the place

>It is by a park, just in case there is a nerd glut the particular moment you ride the bus and they stop somewhere else.

The main hall is graced by a big IBM mainframe, together with all its peripherals: disk drum, data entry console, all the rest. But it did not belong to the University, but to some pioneering computing company in Granada called *Centro de Cálculo de Granada*, which has completely vanished.

Then, walk up two floors to the Department of [Computer Technology and Architecture](http://atc.ugr.es),

>Once you are there, go to the next to last office on the right on the corridor to your left, you might recognize the name of the person there, and if he is in, he will happily sign your copy of this book, or your Kindle or other reading device. Appointment not necessary. 

To the right of the entrance door there is a vitrine with the history of computing as seen from the department. You can see there from *portable* computers from the early 90s, through all kind of peripherals, including a hand scanner that belonged to me, to chips that were designed from scratch in our very own department. All of it neither catalogued, nor labeled, nor acknowledged. We do not even know if it works or not, and it is closer to a storage closet than to a real museum. However, maybe some time from now, maybe even by the time you read this, someone with an interest in retro computing will use it for a master's degree project or a PhD. Or just out of spite, to give it a big of dignity.

When you get out of the building, you might want to visit the biggest data center in Andalucía, the [Cloud Center Andalucía](http://cca.trevenque.es/).
 
>Incidentally, you will go past one of the establishments we talked about in the chapter on whorehouses, the Don Pepe. None are too far, so using a pit stop as an excuse to be there is not an option.

You will not be able to see anything from outside, other than the ditch that connects it to the railway, a few meters away, where the fiber actually goes. But you can [request a visit](http://cca.trevenque.es/instalaciones/) and you will be able to see the watertight rooms where all the racks are stored, the firefighting measures, and the hum of twenty-first century computing all around you. Which is something all geeks love and crave.

>Visits are only available under requests, and then only for a good reason and in a group. So you might want to gather at least half a dozen of friends to do it, and request it well in advance. 

Once you are on a ride, double back and take the freeway around Granada in the Southern direction until you arrive to the "Armilla" exit. The offramp is a balcony onto the Don José, the other funhouse we have mentioned in its chapter. Right across the freeway there is a big, blue, glass building with the name [Axesor](http://axesor.es) on top, surrounded by other tech-related buildings in what we could call a Silicon offramp, which is a nano version of a Silicon Valley. Anyhow, [Axesor](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axesor) is an interesting place, being one of the first pure-play Internet outfits in Spain. It was a long shot by five friends with Physics and other degrees, who decided to create a new company using new tools, the tools of the Internet that was, right them, blooming in Spain. They started as a company giving commercial information, kind of a Spanish Lexis-Nexis, but evolved to the point that it is now one of the first credit rating agencies in Spain.

Once again, not much to see there. You will have to ask for an appointment and then probably a commercial person will give you the lowdown. If you peek into the building, you will see lots of desks with computers and people busy with it. They have an interesting data center and also very exciting credit prediction technology.

>And I know this because we were the origin of that technology through a contract between them and our university.

But algorithms do not a high visual impact, although they have have
all kind of other impacts when your company is the target of the prediction. Maybe the best is to be in one of the cafés around it at coffee time, around 10-11 AM, and listen to their geek conversation or just watch their demeanor, which is probably similar to every other tech company in the world except for the fact that they go outside to have a coffee. Try to make out who are the executives, who are the commercial, who man customer supports, and who is in the basement manhandling the computers that make everything work or programming them.

And, while you are at it, you might see the signs for one such "Spiral startups", in another glass building, right by its side. You might even be able to watch it from outside the shuttered spaces, because it closed a while ago, signaling the onset of the bursting of the coworking bubble in Granada. [Spiral Startups](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spiral-startups) was, at one point in time, one of almost a couple of dozen coworking spaces in Granada. If you are not familiar with the concept, a coworking office is just an open space that provides a desk area, connectivity and amenities to freelancers and startup companies. During the crisis, they were a convenient and cheap alternative to either staying at your parents, renting real office space or crashing at a café. For less than 50€ a month, you could have your very own office to receive customers and interact with fellow entrepreneurs. 

Only maybe it became too much of a good thing. At the height of the phenomenon, there were more coworking spaces in Granada than in any other city in Spain, proving again that, when it comes to geekery, Granada rocks. After closing Spiral, other coworking spaces, like Cocorocó, also shut down, and then smaller ones. The only thriving space right now seems to be [ErranT](http://www.errant.es/), which you are welcome to visit by itself or joining one of the many activities that take place there. 
It is actually very close to one of the biggest cibercafés that existed also in Granada in the late 90s and early aughts, [Red Isis](http://www.exploregranada.com/internet.htm). It is now closed, as the [rest of the public-access computer shops](http://www.andalucia.com/internet/cybercafes/granada.htm), of which there were quite a few in Granada. I have rarely been in such a kind of place in Granada, since the University provided us with Internet access at home since early one. However, there was one in every corner at the beginning of the century, before ADSL became affordable; it even resisted half a dozen of years, until now that we have Internet in our hand through our smartphones.

There might be still one open, plying mainly to migrants who use it mainly to call home, a crowd that is very different of the teens that crowded it back them to maim and kill through Unreal Tournament or other wargames.

Still, local cibercafés had something authentic and were as much a showcase for local culture as pubs or cemeteries. The games played, the size and age of groups, the peek hours, were something to observe. I have been in cibercafés all over the world, and they are also a way of getting acquainted with the local keyboards, as well of being very jealous of security so as not to get your credentials stolen. It is rather safer now, with ubiquitous WiFi, although I would not put all my trust in an open network.

If you are not able to spot any Internet café, then, just look for your inner geek and grab your smartphone. Or maybe try one of the comic bookstores. Actually, one of the most venerable in Granada, Flash, is not so far away, by the end of San Antón street and actually pretty close to the rail relic we talked about in the chapter devoted to the train station. Its narrow storefront is jammed between a coffee and tea shop and a bakery, and you know you are in geek territory from the get go. As you enter through a narrow corridor, you will see right and left Warhammer 40K pieces for coloring and boxes. You will have to dodge or physically push people to advance past the new releases shelf and go around perusing Spanish and European comic, which are to the right and bottom of the library, or American and Japanese comic, to the left. Actually, it is a good occasion to browse [Blacksad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksad), the series of hardboiled graphic novels with a black cat as main character, beautifully drawn and scripted by Díaz Canales and [Juanjo Guarnido, a local artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanjo_Guarnido). Local fanzines are also for sale, and spontaneous discussion are started whenever a few of the usual visitors, of which there are quite a few, meet. This usually happens on Saturdays before closing at 2PM, so this is probably the best time to visit. You might end up with a few friends or maybe enemies, if you happen to like exactly the opposite of what passes as mainstream in the shop, usually American superhero stuff.

Flash is closed on Saturday afternoons, but [Draco](http://www.libreriadraco.com/), the center of the local role playing games community, is not. Actually, there is kind of a gaming triangle that extends down to the end of the Alhamar street, where another shop, [Shazam](http://m.forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=3535022), used to be and if you allow a triangle to have another vertex, Dune used to be a few meters down Pedro Antonio. It is no longer there, and the options for gamers and comicateers have been greatly diminished, although they are well served, and probably will be for many years, with just [Flash](http://www.libreriaflash.com/).

Or, if that fails, by any one of the many comic, anime and RPG-related events that take place almost monthly in Granada. There is a single ComiCon, but Granada boasts [el Salón del Cómic](http://saloncomicgranada.com/), [Japan Weekend](http://www.japanweekend.com/granada/), [FicZone](http://www.ficzone.com/), [Granada Gaming](http://www.granadagaming.com/), with a delicious [Retro Granada area](http://www.granadagaming.com/retro-granada.html) with all kind of home computers and gaming consoles from the 80s and 90s, and which I really enjoyed, besides being able to check out all the local indie game creation scene.

>I am personally not too much into this kind of things, because lately they are more about cosplay and showing off than about talking or learning about comics and sequential art. However, since most people are attending K-Pop contests and karaoke fights, you might have the chance, as I did, to meet and greet comic creators and talk for a while with them, even if you had not heard about them before.

You can also be a hardcore geek of the kind that develops stuff and post it for everyone on [GitHub](http://github.com). If that is the case and you never leave your laptop at home, I have just created [Granada Geek](http://www.meetup.com/es/Granada-Geek/) in MeetUp, so that all groups, entrepreneurs, hacktivists, free software developers, and anyone, can create events for all to see. If it is not there it is probably not happening, but we expect to have something going on every week. 

You can stop reading this and read your Blacksad. When you are done,
keep reading, there is so much more in Granada on and off the beaten track.
