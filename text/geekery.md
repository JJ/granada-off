# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth [Parque de las Ciencias](Parque de las Ciencias), which is the subject of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, spending half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling herds of kids that abound there.

As you get out of the Parque de las ciencias, you can proceed to the so-named "Rotonda del HelicÃ³ptero", or "Helicopter roundabout", which you cannot miss since there is a helicopter there, set up on a rotating axis that makes it look this and that way, depending on wind and ground vibration. It is placed on the way to the [Armilla air base, wing 78 of the Spanish Air Force](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=D7BBF2E4EBCB7EE6C12570DD00429F4B&idRef=1C4723CC4E4142DCC125745900266B6D), precisely the wing that flew it until not so long ago, well into this millenium. This is mainly a traning wing but also houses the ASPA patrol, a helicopter acrobatics team, one of just a few in the world. However, there are only a few scheduled acts if you want to watch them. 

>I remember to spend the time of boring classes during the 80s watching the Bucker 131 biplanes sputtering in the sky, in front of the Facultad de Ciencias. They were true relics of the 20s, and probably the ones that were used to train by current fighter pilots in the Spanish air force.

That helicopter is an [Sikorsky S-76C or HE24 in SpAF denomination](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=CF3470AF935F8396C12570D700464251&idRef=F28FEDE5105891C6C12576350030E54B), was acquired in 1991 and used mainly for instrumental training in the wing, although it could be used also for ferrying people or rescue missions. It is one of the [most modern helos in the SpAF](http://www.ala78virtual.es/contenidos/flota.htm), so I do not really understand what is the deal with it. Maybe it was originally bought second hand or something. You can see it in action in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fvo2hnYzu4) and check its former locations in [this helospotters database](http://www.helis.com/database/cn/3517/)

>Last annotation is mine, I guess. It did not mention it was retired from service.
