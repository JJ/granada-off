# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth
[Parque de las Ciencias](Parque de las Ciencias), which is the subject
of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a
whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, devoting
half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the
aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a
nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling
herds of kids that abound there. Also, since budget for these places is always kind of
tight, a showcase for retro computing if there was one: check out some
of the vintage IBM and Apple computers that are the engines of some of
the rides, which, in some cases, have not been upgraded since the
nineties. Why should they? They work like a charm.

Even if you are not visiting the Museum itself, the lobby and free
areas are a place designed to stay. Take a selfie with Einstein, and
then proceed to the gift shop, which is probably the geekiest toy shop
in Granada. Besides lots of interesting science books you will not
able to find anywhere else, you can buy lots of very interesting solar
toys, including model kits, Schleich animals and all kind of
ready-made dinosaurs and building kits for them, and all kind of
novelty toys. If you are into Escher or mathematical games, there is a
bit of everything there; unfortunately, they do not stock many English
language books.

The rest of the lobby is filled with physical experiments: you can
rotate a big sphere filled with milky liquids to create your own
Jupiter spot, see a small mechanical model of the solar system or rock
a lava-lamp like glass cabinet to see how sediments accumulate. And
then you can have a capuccino in the Darwin café, with free WiFi and
also computers you can freely use, a great place to meet other geeks
like you to share tips and hacks from this book.

But this science museum, which is the second tourist destination in
Granada right behind the Alhambra, is not the only one devoted to it
in the city.
Unbeknownst to most people, including probably 90% of the people in
Granada, the first science museum was created in a high school, and it
is might still be there.

>But it might not, or be completely shuttered by the time you read
>this. Books survive longer than museums, apparently.

It is the
[science museum of the Padre Suárez institute](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_de_Ciencias_del_Instituto_Padre_Su%C3%A1rez_de_Granada).

>The
>[*Padre Suárez", or father Suárez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Su%C3%A1rez),
>that gives his name to the institute was, you guessed it, a Jesuit
>that died in the XVII century. He was mainly into philosophy and he
>was born in Granada. Another example of the curious relationship
>between Jesuits and science by way of a science museum housed in a
>building that bears his name.

By the time you read this, it might or might not be open, although you
can [request a visit in his web site](http://www.museosuarez.blogspot.com.es/p/solicitud-de-visita.html). The domain
that hosted its pages is for sale and it has had to move [to BlogSpot](http://www.museosuarez.blogspot.com.es/), and the
[person in charge of it retired, with the Ministry of Education not relieving any of his  colleagues from classes](http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2015/11/02/56375619268e3e025c8b460e.html). So
it might be shuttered and gathering dust by now, another example of
permanent things disappearing while the transient stays. If you manage
to find it open and somebody willing to give you the spiel, there are
four rooms filled with stuffed animals, mockups, physics and chemistry
instruments and something called
[Dr. Kagerah's boxes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43095111@N08/sets/72157622355913429),
which is so much like the title of a terror movie that you totally
have to go and check it out.

In fact, it is really worth the while to
have a look at them, because they might be the only ones left in the
whole wide world. I have not been able to find much about them, but
what I have been able to find is that they were variously called
["Dr. Kagerah's cabinets"](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038095/1911-02-01/ed-1/seq-11.pdf)
or
["Dr. Kagerah Technological Educational Appliances"](http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Western_Drawing_and_Manual_Training_Association_Twenty-First_Annual_1000351269/201). And
they were created by Carl or Karl Kagerah, who apparently lived first
in Hamburg and then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He sold these boxes
to museums, banks and all kind of companies, and its intention was to
show industrial processes. It is difficult to know nowadays what they
are
about. [This one, for instance, could be about paper](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43095111@N08/3965471837/in/album-72157622355913429/)
while
[this one is about the products of corn](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43095111@N08/3970953265/in/dateposted/),
mainly because there is a corncob on the left hand side. They are
apparently labeled in English, German or even Spanish, but their intent
and quaintness are really worth a visit. Maybe you can puzzle out what
they are about. 

Which you need not do with
[Dr. Auzoux anatomical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Thomas_J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Auzoux). This
person created realistic anatomical models made of *papier mâché* in the
early 1800. Created in puzzle-like fashion, you could take them apart
to show the structure: veins, bones, muscles and everything. Maybe not
for the faint of hear, but definitely a scientific antique of the
first order, which, again, can fetch a high price for those who are
into this kind of thing.

>Have 300 euro to spare? [You can own your own *papier mâché* brain](http://www.ebay.es/itm/Auzoux-Rare-demi-cerveau-en-platre-ou-moule-mere-neurologie-anatomie-ecorche-/331749331697?hash=item4d3dcd12f1:g:7n4AAOSwPcVVrX8~)!

If you do not make it into the building,
[this Flickr gallery might give you an idea of what you are missing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43095111@N08/),
like
[this, er, oriental royal XIX century bong](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43095111@N08/3971686818/in/dateposted/).

Sorry about the lighter note of that paragraph above, I really cannot
help it, but it is really serious that this scientific and technical
patrimony will go missing or just hidden. Besides,
[the institute was the first one in Granada, built in the 1840s](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Padre_Su%C3%A1rez),
and some outstanding citizens like Francisco Ayala, Ángel Ganivet,
Asunción Linares, Elena Martín Vivaldi and
Federico García Lorca. Asunción Linares was, in fact, the first woman
to become
[professor in Sciences](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n_Linares)
in Spain and only the second one after the Civil War. So, there you
go. The museum was quite useful for awakening scientific consciences,
and in this era where we need so many STEM graduates, its utility
should be considered even more.

That small museum is not too far away from the Facultad de Medicina,
the Faculty of Medicine of the UGR, where another local geek,
[Federico Olóriz](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Ol%C3%B3riz_Aguilera),
started to study when he was 16.

>Actually, the Faculty of Medicine was not there in the late 1800s,
>but allow me the license.

He is better known for the
[so-called Vucetich-Olóriz fingerprint classification system](https://books.google.es/books?id=7HMmmypL2DwC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=vucetich+oloriz+dactiloscopy&source=bl&ots=UWqsmJSIix&sig=9qefvzVqklC9OWDfvU1L_9Svtck&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6xbTdobXKAhWBxhoKHdNXBR4Q6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&q=vucetich%20oloriz%20dactiloscopy&f=false). He
was not the first to develop a way of describing fingerprints to store
and compare them. However, he was the creator of the system that was
used in Spain for more than 60 years, until automatic processing was
available. The fact that he shares the name with another person is
because he stood on the shoulders of the giant Argentinian researcher
who created the system by the end of the 1800s. The systems used in
the US, such as the Flak Conley system, were developed more or less at
the same time... The science in Spain was relatively
advanced by that time, and the University of Granada was no
exception. Not always was it published or presented where it should
have been. If you make a right from the door of the Faculty and keep
walking past one of the highest buildings in Granada, you will
eventually arrive to Doctor Olóriz street. At least in this case a
local figure got his due, although diluted in a sea of streets all
devoted to other not so well known doctors.

>method. 

Other than the street and as is usual, there is not much to remind the
average Granadian of this local glory. There was a
[temporal exhibition at the Parque de las Ciencias](http://www.andalucia.org/es/eventos/exposicion-proposito-de-oloriz/),
and you can still buy the exhibition catalog in the gift shop. And his
ashes were eventually buried in the
[vault of illustrious Granadians](https://www.flickr.com/photos/landahlauts/5553336175),
very  inaugurated in 2012 with his burial. 

But let us ride the LAC to go back to the big science museum brother,
and as you get out it, you can proceed to the so-named "Rotonda del Helicóptero", or "Helicopter roundabout", which you cannot miss since there is a helicopter there, set up on a rotating axis that makes it look this and that way, depending on wind and ground vibration. It is placed on the way to the [Armilla air base, wing 78 of the Spanish Air Force](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=D7BBF2E4EBCB7EE6C12570DD00429F4B&idRef=1C4723CC4E4142DCC125745900266B6D), precisely the wing that flew it until not so long ago, well into this millenium. This is mainly a training wing but also houses the [patrulla ASPA](http://patrullaaspa.defensa.gob.es/es/index.html), a helicopter aerobatics team that features the new Eurocopter, one of just half a dozen in the world. However, there are only a few scheduled acts if you want to watch them. 

>I remember to spend the time of boring classes during the 80s
>watching the Bucker 131 biplanes sputtering in the sky, in front of
>the Facultad de Ciencias. They were true relics of the 20s, and
>probably the ones that were used to get trained by current fighter pilots
>in the Spanish Air Force (SpAF).

That helicopter is an [Sikorsky S-76C Spirit or HE24 in SpAF denomination](http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag?idDoc=CF3470AF935F8396C12570D700464251&idRef=F28FEDE5105891C6C12576350030E54B), was acquired in 1991 and used mainly for instrumental training in the wing, although it could be used also for ferrying people or rescue missions. It is one of the [most modern helos in the SpAF](http://www.ala78virtual.es/contenidos/flota.htm), so I do not really understand what is the deal with it. Maybe it was originally bought second hand or something. You can see it in action in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fvo2hnYzu4) and check its former locations in [this helospotters database](http://www.helis.com/database/cn/3517/)

>Last annotation is mine, I guess. The page did not mention it was retired from service.

Actually, the previous location was the aforementioned Parque de las
Ciencias, where it apparently went after
[the engine broke, according to a tweet](https://twitter.com/WanManolo/status/681797531421007872). And
it was placed there to celebrate the centennial of aviation in
Spain. Curiously enough, the plane was called S-76 to celebrate the
*bicentennial* of the US.

>So, two centennials of disparate entities in a single decorated
>roundabout.

This type of helicopter has also got a much
[geekier version, the S-76 Shadow](http://www.kamov.net/general-aviation/s-76-shadow/),
with an awkward-looking but coolly operated through a Heads-Up Display
front-mounted single-pilot cabin. And that is a sentence with a lot of
dashes.  

>More about roundabouts in its very own chapter.

If you continue in the direction of the Avenida de América, that is
right if you come from Parque de las Ciencias, and go past the
exit of the underground tunnel, where, who knows, you might even see a
train coming or going, go past the nano-Manhattan by the end of that
avenue, with a couple of tall buildings, and then, when you arrive at
the boulevard with the frayed European flags, take a left and you will arrive at
the
[Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, IAA or Andalusian Astrophysics institute](http://iaa.es). You
cannot miss it, it is the one with the rocket protruding out of its
front garden. It
is quite an open place where you can pop in and ask someone about
[the Rosetta mission](http://rosetta.iaa.es/noticias) or about
exoplanets, since this institute includes discoverers of one of the
first ones. Instruments for spatial missions are created here, and
there are a few on display. The rocket, for instance. It is an
atmospheric research probe which was designed here and launched in the
eighties, starting
[our regional space race](http://www.ideal.es/granada/culturas/201511/22/nosotros-empezamos-carrera-espacial-20151114215419.html).

>In this interview, José Manuel Vílchez mentions Manuel Merlo Vallejo,
>a Jesuit that was in the origins of the current Institute. Another
>case of Jesuits going hand in hand with science in Granada. More on
>this on the chapter about the university. 

From there it is just a short stretch to the Paseo de la Bomba, which
you cannot miss if you are into big steam machines, or into steampunk.

>from there, described in the chapter on hauntings.

Despite its name, which might or might not be due to a bomb falling
there in the civil war or maybe to the fact that there was a big pump
for the *Acequia Gorda*, or big irrigation ditch or maybe to the
[fountain at the beginning which doest not look at all like a bomb](http://1000-reinogranada.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/fuente-de-los-cuatro-leones.html);
*bomba* means either *bomb* or *pump* in Spanish, and the big machine
is the roundabout could be a steam-operated pump, but is actually a
press belonging to a sugar-producing *ingenio* or "engine", which is
what sugar mills were called at the beginning of the Century, when
high sugar prices brought unknown wealth to many countries and regions
in the world, including Granada. The machine was produced in 1905 by
[Fives-Lille](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fives-Lille), a company
which was also in charge of building railways all along eastern
Andalucía and the lift inside the Eiffel Tower. Surprisingly, Fives-Lille endures to this very day, although under the
name of Fives. All steampunks should
know about this company, responsible for lots of iron bridges and
scary-looking machines in Andalucía.

This machine, along with the modernist mansions in the city center and
the Gran Vía, are testimony of that era
[when Granada depended on a different monoculture](http://granadapedia.wikanda.es/wiki/Historia_de_la_ca%C3%B1a_de_az%C3%BAcar). In
this case, this machine was part of the *azucarera* San José, which
was placed exactly, or rather pretty much, in this place, maybe a bit
North of that, since to the South-West, where there is a wood-paneled
building now, there was a tram depot for the railway line that made
the trip to the Sierra, and by Sierra in Granada we mean Sierra
Nevada, the sierra par excellence. This tram was dismantled in the
early 70s, to never come back until now. Or maybe 2016. Who knows.

That tram was, for some time, placed in la [Facultad de Ciencias, or Faculty of Sciences, of the University of Granada](http://fciencias.ugr.es/en/). It might or might not be there by the time you read this, since it was taken for restoration and has not returned. However, there is another steam engine parked there and you can always check [the building itself](http://patrimonio3d.ugr.es/index.php/granada/edificios/item/60-facultad-de-ciencias), which was projected and built in the sixties although it has had lots of additions. There is some fodder for geeks inside the building, where all kind of sciences, from Physics to Geology, are studied. To the right hand side, the Physics building houses a Foucault pendulum, and going from there to the main building, the library to the right hand side houses scientific journals from early on, the fifties and even before that. I have spent there a good part of my studies in the eighties, and I was elated to find an article by Einstein himself, published in the fifties in some Physics journal. Quite an interesting, if a bit over the top of my head, reading.

The main hall has all kind of widgets: rockets, other engines, maybe
some other temporary exhibitions, and, from there on, the Biology
building, which lies to the right, has a rather creepy stuffed animals vitrine, and the geology departments all kind of rocks. There is nothing but people in the Maths area, and in the Chemistry little but pungent smells.

If you go across the parking to the next building and ask nicely, you might be able to visit [Alhambra, our very own supercomputer](http://alhambra.ugr.es/), which is not open to the public but there will probably be someone proud enough in [computing services of the University](http://csirc.ugr.es) to show it to you. That is the precise building where the ur-geeks of the eighties spent our time, because it housed the first computer lab, filled with IBM XTs, and where you had to dress nicely, no shorts, if you did not want to be expelled by the janitors. This building housed the university mainframes for some time, and it still has a big data center.

If you want to see one of those computers, you will have to catch the
SN3 bus to the [ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es), a geek place if there
is one in Granada. You cannot miss the stop: where the nerd-looking
guys get down from the bus, that is the place

>That bus stop is by a park, just in case there is a nerd glut the particular moment you ride the bus and they stop somewhere else.

The main hall is graced by a big [IBM System/3 mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/3), together
with all its peripherals: disk drum, data entry console, all the
rest. But it did not belong to the University, but to some pioneering
computing company in Granada called *Centro de Cálculo de Granada* and
eventually
[Indesa, which went belly up](http://www.einforma.com/servlet/app/prod/DATOS_DE/EMPRESA/INDESA-INFORMATICA-SA-C_QTE4MDEzMzkx_de-GRANADA.html)
sometime in the early nineties, when the web was coming up and when
computing was something you did in computing shops, not at home or in
a bracelet. That is, you needed to have your payroll computed, take it
there. Or if you are an architect and needed your structures checked
so that the building does not fall off. The name computing services
received back then, "Computing centre", is a witness to this kind of
thing. You took your computing jobs to the centre, and actually when I
was doing my degree you had to submit your program to a central queue
and you got the result in a continuous paper listing in drawers once
it was finished. Computing literally meant walking back and
forth, which I guess was good for us. Now we have gone full circle,
and it is the computer you have in your pocket the one that makes you
walk by counting your steps and complaining if you do not make your 10K
daily limit.

The
history of this company, along with the whole history of computing in
Granada, has yet to be written. Which is a pity, because it probably
will never be. Google does not tell much about it, and these pioneers
of computing in the city will be all but forgotten in a generation.

However, that is not the case for the aforementioned computer: the Wikipedia says that this
particular model was introduced in 1969 and discontinued in 1985. I can assume it has been
gutted for parts, since
[processors and other parts can fetch several dozens euros in eBay](http://www.ebay.es/itm/IBM-5203-04N6698-500MHz-4-Way-RS64-III-SMP-4MB-L2-Proc-for-7026-M80-pSeries-/271294722087).
With exactly the same height and color-coordinated, you would say it
is part of the same thing, and I am not sure it was not, there is a
Digital RA82 disk drive. This disk had all of 622Megabytes, that is,
it could store 150 songs or so, much less than your current phone. And
it could set you back, well, a lot. You can still buy it for several hundred
dollars in, where else, eBay. I do not know if it works today, but
they would make a great prop for a practical joke for freshmen, if
only we could rig an Arduino or some other thing and make its light
blink and do a bit of beeping and booping. The *native* disk, however,
was the IBM 5444, which is there, together with the IBM 5203 Line
Printer, the big glass cabinet which was used to know when your print
job had finished. 

The development of this line of computers has followed to this day,
with the
[IBM system i series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_i). This
mean that some application running in that system in the 70s could,
theoretically still run in modern i Series servers. There will
probably no other way out, since its outdated representation that used
EBCDIC and uncommon operating system means that the supply of expert
programmers might not be exactly increasing.

Despite this, you have to hand it to these old computers: they had a quality that new computers do not
have. They are big and they can be used to support other things.

>Lots of possible decorations were lost when *big head* monitors gave

That
is way it has eventually accreted other computer and computer-like
things. To the left hand side something that looks like, and probably
is, a telephone manual switchboard built by Standard Eléctrica, a
Spanish subsidiary to AT&T. Beautifully encased in wood,
it could be mistaken by a dormitory cabinet. A
[Datapoint 1500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint) "terminal"
is supported by a set of Shugart disk drives, that seem to be an
integral part of it but they are not, although they were sold together, only they are decorated with the
same uniform *computer beige* that was the single hue for computers
until, I guess, Apple came. This terminal, and the company indeed, are
quite remarkable, and not only because the keyboard feels like real.

>Just type in it. Enjoy the feedback and the return of the keys. In a
>40-year old computer, no less.

But also because
[they charged almost 6000$ at the time, the early 80s](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=849&dat=19771010&id=npkmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=a1QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5965,540795&hl=en)
and its company was the precursor of the modern microprocessor
architecture, designing for the Datapoint 2200 (not this one) a
processor that would eventually become the famous Intel 8008, which is
still a tiny part of every Intel computer you (and I) use. The
computer itself has the power of a 2$ Arduino, with 32K of RAM and a
processor with a few megahertz. But, well, that is progress for
you. And I do not know where it comes from. I have not seen anything
like that in the university; it interfaced with IBM computers, so it
might come from the same source.

Continuing with the piling up of computer-like things, there is also a
electronic typewriter which I remember having seen in our department
secretary. Which is where you could go next: Walk up two floors to the
Department of
[Computer Technology and Architecture](http://atc.ugr.es). 

>Once you are there, go to the next to last office on the right on the corridor to your left, you might recognize the name of the person there, and if he is in, he will happily sign your copy of this book, or your Kindle or other reading device. Appointment not necessary. 

To the right of the entrance door there is a vitrine with the history of computing as seen from the department. You can see there from *portable* computers from the early 90s, through all kind of peripherals, including a hand scanner that belonged to me, to chips that were designed from scratch in our very own department. All of it neither catalogued, nor labeled, nor acknowledged. We do not even know if it works or not, and it is closer to a storage closet than to a real museum. However, maybe some time from now, maybe even by the time you read this, someone with an interest in retro computing will use it for a master's degree project or a PhD. Or just out of spite, to give it a big of dignity.

When you get out of the building, you might want to visit the biggest data center in Andalucía, the [Cloud Center Andalucía](http://cca.trevenque.es/).
 
>Incidentally, you will go past one of the establishments we talked about in the chapter on whorehouses, the Don Pepe. None are too far, so using a pit stop as an excuse to be there is not an option.

You will not be able to see anything from outside, other than the ditch that connects it to the railway, a few meters away, where the fiber actually goes. But you can [request a visit](http://cca.trevenque.es/instalaciones/) and you will be able to see the watertight rooms where all the racks are stored, the firefighting measures, and the hum of twenty-first century computing all around you. Which is something all geeks love and crave.

>Visits are only available under requests, and then only for a good reason and in a group. So you might want to gather at least half a dozen of friends to do it, and request it well in advance. 

Once you are on a ride, double back and take the freeway around Granada in the Southern direction until you arrive to the "Armilla" exit. The offramp is a balcony onto the Don José, the other funhouse we have mentioned in its chapter. Right across the freeway there is a big, blue, glass building with the name [Axesor](http://axesor.es) on top, surrounded by other tech-related buildings in what we could call a Silicon offramp, which is a nano version of a Silicon Valley. Anyhow, [Axesor](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axesor) is an interesting place, being one of the first pure-play Internet outfits in Spain. It was a long shot by five friends with Physics and other degrees, who decided to create a new company using new tools, the tools of the Internet that was, right them, blooming in Spain. They started as a company giving commercial information, kind of a Spanish Lexis-Nexis, but evolved to the point that it is now one of the first credit rating agencies in Spain.

Once again, not much to see there. You will have to ask for an appointment and then probably a commercial person will give you the lowdown. If you peek into the building, you will see lots of desks with computers and people busy with it. They have an interesting data center and also very exciting credit prediction technology.

>And I know this because we were the origin of that technology through a contract between them and our university.

But algorithms do not a high visual impact, although they have
all kind of other impacts when your company is the target of the prediction. Maybe the best is to be in one of the cafés around it at coffee time, around 10-11 AM, and listen to their geek conversation or just watch their demeanor, which is probably similar to every other tech company in the world except for the fact that they go outside to have a coffee. Try to make out who are the executives, who are the commercial, who man customer supports, and who is in the basement manhandling the computers that make everything work or programming them.

And, while you are at it, you might see the signs for one such "Spiral startups", in another glass building, right by its side. You might even be able to watch it from outside the shuttered spaces, because it closed a while ago, signaling the onset of the bursting of the coworking bubble in Granada. [Spiral Startups](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spiral-startups) was, at one point in time, one of almost a couple of dozen coworking spaces in Granada. If you are not familiar with the concept, a coworking office is just an open space that provides a desk area, connectivity and amenities to freelancers and startup companies. During the crisis, they were a convenient and cheap alternative to either staying at your parents, renting real office space or crashing at a café. For less than 50€ a month, you could have your very own office to receive customers and interact with fellow entrepreneurs. 

Only maybe it became too much of a good thing. At the height of the phenomenon, there were more coworking spaces in Granada than in any other city in Spain, proving again that, when it comes to geekery, Granada rocks. After closing Spiral, other coworking spaces, like Cocorocó, also shut down, and then smaller ones. The only thriving space right now seems to be [ErranT](http://www.errant.es/), which you are welcome to visit by itself or joining one of the many activities that take place there. 
It is actually very close to one of the biggest cibercafés that existed also in Granada in the late 90s and early aughts, [Red Isis](http://www.exploregranada.com/internet.htm). It is now closed, as the [rest of the public-access computer shops](http://www.andalucia.com/internet/cybercafes/granada.htm), of which there were quite a few in Granada. I have rarely been in such a kind of place in Granada, since the University provided us with Internet access at home since early one. However, there was one in every corner at the beginning of the century, before ADSL became affordable; it even resisted half a dozen of years, until now that we have Internet in our hand through our smartphones.

There might be still one open, plying mainly to migrants who use it mainly to call home, a crowd that is very different of the teens that crowded it back them to maim and kill through Unreal Tournament or other wargames.

Still, local cibercafés had something authentic in them and were as
much a showcase for local living culture as pubs or cemeteries, these
later for living as well as dead culture, of course. The games played, the size and age of groups, the peek hours, were something to observe. I have been in cibercafés all over the world, and they are also a way of getting acquainted with the local keyboards, as well of being very jealous of security so as not to get your credentials stolen. It is rather safer now, with ubiquitous WiFi, although I would not put all my trust in an open network.

If you are not able to spot any Internet café, then, just look for your inner geek and grab your smartphone. Or maybe try one of the comic bookstores. Actually, one of the most venerable in Granada, Flash, is not so far away, by the end of San Antón street and actually pretty close to the rail relic we talked about in the chapter devoted to the train station. Its narrow storefront is jammed between a coffee and tea shop and a bakery, and you know you are in geek territory from the get go. As you enter through a narrow corridor, you will see right and left Warhammer 40K pieces for coloring and boxes. You will have to dodge or physically push people to advance past the new releases shelf and go around perusing Spanish and European comic, which are to the right and bottom of the library, or American and Japanese comic, to the left. Actually, it is a good occasion to browse [Blacksad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksad), the series of hardboiled graphic novels with a black cat as main character, beautifully drawn and scripted by Díaz Canales and [Juanjo Guarnido, a local artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanjo_Guarnido). Local fanzines are also for sale, and spontaneous discussion are started whenever a few of the usual visitors, of which there are quite a few, meet. This usually happens on Saturdays before closing at 2PM, so this is probably the best time to visit. You might end up with a few friends or maybe enemies, if you happen to like exactly the opposite of what passes as mainstream in the shop, usually American superhero stuff.

Flash is closed on Saturday afternoons, but [Draco](http://www.libreriadraco.com/), the center of the local role playing games community, is not. Actually, there is kind of a gaming triangle that extends down to the end of the Alhamar street, where another shop, [Shazam](http://m.forocoches.com/foro/showthread.php?t=3535022), used to be and if you allow a triangle to have another vertex, Dune used to be a few meters down Pedro Antonio. It is no longer there, and the options for gamers and comicateers have been greatly diminished, although they are well served, and probably will be for many years, with just [Flash](http://www.libreriaflash.com/).

Or, if that fails, by any one of the many comic, anime and RPG-related events that take place almost monthly in Granada. There is a single ComiCon, but Granada boasts [el Salón del Cómic](http://saloncomicgranada.com/), [Japan Weekend](http://www.japanweekend.com/granada/), [FicZone](http://www.ficzone.com/), [Granada Gaming](http://www.granadagaming.com/), with a delicious [Retro Granada area](http://www.granadagaming.com/retro-granada.html) with all kind of home computers and gaming consoles from the 80s and 90s, and which I really enjoyed, besides being able to check out all the local indie game creation scene.

>I am personally not too much into this kind of things, because lately they are more about cosplay and showing off than about talking or learning about comics and sequential art. However, since most people are attending K-Pop contests and karaoke fights, you might have the chance, as I did, to meet and greet comic creators and talk for a while with them, even if you had not heard about them before.

You can also be a hardcore geek of the kind that develops stuff and post it for everyone on [GitHub](http://github.com). If that is the case and you never leave your laptop at home, I have just created [Granada Geek](http://www.meetup.com/es/Granada-Geek/) in MeetUp, so that all groups, entrepreneurs, hacktivists, free software developers, and anyone, can create events for all to see. If it is not there it is probably not happening, but we expect to have something going on every week. 

You can stop reading this and read your Blacksad. When you are done,
keep reading this, there is so much more in Granada on and off the beaten
track.

Or you can go and visit the Alhambra.

>You have done it already, right? You can now go back and do it again,
>but going off the beaten track. Is there a track not beaten to death
>in the Alhambra? Yes. Just look up, look at the patterns, and look at
>it with the eyes of mathematics.

Brush up your math first. Because to walk of the beaten track you need
sturdy boots and math. Remember studying symmetry groups? I do not,
either. Anyway, it is basically a way of covering a surface by picking
up a motif, twisting, moving it, and flipping it. Get a black and
white square, for instance. You copy/paste it and you have got
two. Then turn it around clockwise, and you will have two squares with
perpendicular motifs. You can keep and turning it until you get bored,
and then copy the whole thing and flip it around.
Well, whatever you do it, you can do it in 17 different ways: that is
[Fedorov's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_graph_%28geometry%29), which was proposed by, you guessed it, Fedorov
in 1891.

>It is actually known as Fedorov-Schoenflies, or even
>Fedorov-Schoenflies-Bieberbach theorem. Actually the first two guys
>discovered it independently, because Fedorov did it first, but
>published it only in Russian and did not have Twitter and Google
>Translate for the world to know, so that other guy did it all over
>again. Third one generalized it to more dimensions. But the Alhambra
>is only three-dimensional in space, so we will not pay attention to
>the later.

Well, it so happens that
[the Alhambra is the only historical site, prior to Fedorov's theorem, that includes the 17 groups](http://www.ralph-abraham.org/articles/MS%23145.Alhambra/ms145.pdf). Is
that not incredible? Just go there and practice looking at the
beautiful inlaid tiles. Look for a pattern: a colored 6- or 8-point star, an
arabesque, whatever. Does it repeat itself? Is it flipped in the next
group over? Does it rotate around? Take
[this guide](http://thales.cica.es/rd/Recursos/rd99/ed99-0084-02/capitulo4.html)
and try to identify the different symmetry groups in the repetition
patterns, or take some drawings home for reference.

Which is exactly what
[Maurits Cornelius Escher did, and did it twice](http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Alhambra_and_The_Alcazar_%28Spain%29). He
visited the Alhambra twice: once in 1926 or 27, and the second time in
1936, three months before the Spanish Civil war. In fact, he had
created tessellations, which are tilings of the surface, somewhat
before that, in the early 20s, but, after his second visit, where he
took detailed notes, he started to create his amazing "Metamorphoses",
where one kind of tessellation, say, black and white squares, evolve
into another, hexagons, going through gekkos and turtles and some
mosaics that are, in fact, incredibly similar to what you find today
in the Alhambra. He continued doing that kind of tilings mixing devils
and angels, for instance, well into the 60s. And his inspiration was
right here or maybe, right now, in front of you, in a humble set of
majolica tiles in a 700 year old building.

As was the inspiration also for one of the local über-geeks:
[José Valdelomar or Val del Omar](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Val_del_Omar),
widely unknown in Spain as well as elsewhere. In 1934, he created
["Vibración de Granada"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869808/?ref_=nm_flmg_cin_7),
a short silent film that
[portraits the Alhambra and the whole city](http://www.valdelomar.com/cine3.php?lang=es&menu_act=5&cine1_cod=4&cine2_cod=12&cine3_codi=31)
as a succession of short scenes that include fishes swimming in a fountain, reflections on the water
and, at one time, a plane flying overhead. You can see a bit of David
Lynch there, only 60 years prior to Twin Peaks. At
the time, Valdelomar was involved with the "Pedagogic missions",
itinerant workshops and shows created by the Republican Government; he
was introduced to them by Federico García Lorca.

However, his geekery stems on his work on the machinery of the
cinema. During the second world war, he
[registered a patent](http://invenes.oepm.es/InvenesWeb/detalle?referencia=P0168257)
for what would now be called binaural sound. He wanted to create an
integral experience with moviegoing, and in fact, the wrapping sound
that is now implanted in many movie theaters was shown by him for the
first time in a movie festival in Berlin in 1955. He experimented also
with what is called now
[haptic perception](https://pilotodigital.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/video-mapping-percepcion-haptica-y-simulacro/),
being thus a pioneer of video mapping.

However, he was ostracized, being ideologically contrary to the Franco
regime. His work was discovered only after his death, with
[exhibitions in the national art museum](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/actividades/archipielago-val-omar)
and [release of his work](https://vimeo.com/josevaldelomar) which, of
course, can be enjoyed much better with the full sensory experience he
favored. Although he went on to live in Madrid, he returns to Granada
often and can be seen in
[these candid domestic videos](https://vimeo.com/40709352). That is
why you will not be able to see much of him, unless there is
[an exhibition](http://granadaocio.es/event/exposicion-val-del-omar-111-111-aniversario-del-nacimiento-en-granada/). There
is a Val del Omar room in the Parque de las Ciencias, and there is a
[Val del Omar prize for experimental cinema ](http://www.filmfest-granada.com/blog/el-xxi-festival-internacional-de-jovenes-realizadores-de-granada-anuncia-parte-de-su-palmares/9-meter-ganador-premio-val-del-omar)
at the Young Cinematographers Festival in Granada. So let him live in
your memory, or remember him when you watch Star Wars with surround
sound.
