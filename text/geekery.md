# Assorted geekery

Geeks travel too. And when we arrive to some place we are, sometimes, less interested in watching old stones than in tech meetings,  little museums with engineering feats, or science related places.

>I remember, for instance, seeing and playing a Theremin in a small electricity museum in Barranco, Lima. That was the only time I have been able to do so. Air and space museums in Madrid, war museums in Poland, Vienna and London, all those, are kind of really *off* the beaten track and also in the suburbs, because there are only so many places downtown where you can squeeze a few tanks and a bomber plane.

We have that in Granada, starting with the behemoth Parque de las Ciencias, which is the subject of jokes for its constant expansion, filling now more than a park, a whole block. You can very well spend the whole day there, spending half day in the temporal exhibitions and then proceed to the rest: the aviary, planetary and many other things ending with *ary*. Really a nice place and a source of learning if you can just stand the yelling herds of kids that abound there.
