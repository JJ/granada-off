#Brothels and whorehouses

Let us be clear here. I am not encouraging you to visit *the interior*
of this kind of places. You are obviously free to do so, and I will
remain non-judgmental about it, but this chapter is not intended as an
endorsement to the kind of behaviors that made this kind of
establishments possible in the first place. 

However, this is an off the beaten track kind of book. You must
acknowledge that Lonely Planet does not include a *lewd* route in
their otherwise excellent guides or that Fodor's gives one, two or
three stars to kinky houses. So it is our turn to look at them from a
cultural or architectural point of view and how they contribute to the overall image of
the city.

>Or for that matter, of the country that makes the image of a

Besides, prostitution in Granada has been the
[topic of a book that was going to be published by a scholar in the university](http://www.granadahoy.com/article/granada/540676/geografia/la/prostitucion/granada.html),
although it eventually became
[just an article](http://www.rigys.org/estudio/0197.pdf), which you
can download and read yourself. So there is a lot of documentation to draw from.

All over Spain, first thing that characterize an establishment where people sell their body is neon. Since we are an old
country, we do not care about these newish things that are the subject
of
[podcasts and history books elsewhere](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/tube-benders/). But
most adults and every single truck driver in Spain knows that colored
neon by the roadside is a milestone that indicates a place where you
can get your rocks off. So to find them in Granada you will mostly
have to drive *around*, not *inside*, the city, and do it by night. There are a couple that are withing
walking distance of the city itself, and they bear almost the same
name: Don Pepe and Don José. You can find quite a few more if you do some
perfunctory search in Google, although maybe you should not do that;
however, the first one run, at one particular point in time, radio ads,
and the second one can be clearly seen if you travel South through the
freeway in a strip mall between Granada and Armilla, right next to a
*wok* buffet, which, by the time you read this, might be a salad buffet or a pizza buffet, a sporting goods store, and Toys'r'us. The usual place
where you can find this kind of things, in short. It is also across
the road from one of the mini-Silicon Valleys in town, about which we talk
about extensively in its chapter, and this is not the only time
technology and leisure are so close. A
[company located in the province of Granada has released an app, Q-Mapp, that geolocates sex services](http://www.eleconomista.es/apps/noticias/7283988/01/16/Una-empresa-de-Granada-lanza-una-app-que-geolocaliza-servicios-sexuales.html). It
has quickly been dubbed "the Uber of sex", and baptized, if you allow
the pun, with a
completely inoffensive name,
[Q-Mapp](http://www.q-mapp.es/#no-back-button), presumably to not show 
up with a lurid name from your credit card account. Apart from that, there is no such a
thing as the Toronto Escort Review Board yet, and in fact, there is no
TERB now because it seems to have closed, but you know
[what they say about the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo). And
they say it in the musical Avenue Q. There goes the origin of the Q in
the app name.

But the question is, Would you want to go to Don José, and take a few pictures from the outside?

>If you do it, be discrete and if some burly dressed-in-black guy comes up to you, run back to your car and speed away.

Well, why not? The Amsterdam red-light district, although at times looks
like a Disneyfication of sexploitation, is a big attraction, the same
as the Reeperbahn in Hamburg and other seedy places all over the
world, including Times Square in the eighties. You can go, buy cheap
sports t-shirts and then turn around the corner and sneak a picture of
the neon signs, which, anywhere in the world, imply decadence and
shabbiness. A seediness that might not be something to be proud of,
but that can be otherwise put to work by creating alternative places
to visit in the city. Which is what this book is all about. 

There are also some places in Granada where you might see the sex traders of the
peripatetic variety. Which, of course, almost includes the word
*pathetic* in it, so I guess it is the kind of thing that it is best
completely avoided. However, sometimes it is just impossible to do
it. You walk down the street, and here you have a score of scantily
clad women, separated by a preestablished and regular number of
meters, and generally walking up and down the kerb to stave off the
night chill. Not so long ago, when the buses stopped running in Paseo
del Salón, it was one place where they could be seen; this is
mentioned too in the study linked above. It is close to a park, which
is a convenient place to perform the service. Empty spaces,
consequences of the real estate bubble, are probably the natural environment
of the other areas: Almanjáyar and the road to Jaén. However, the first area
has now no vehicle traffic, except for bikes and skates, and the
second has been gentrified, or rather strip-malled, with the addition
of fast-food joints, a hotel and heavy traffic going to nearby
malls. So it is difficult to say where they are now. At least for
me. Anyone looking for it will find it sooner or later. 

It is also impossible to say where they will be in the moment you read
this. Except for the Don Pepe and Don José, which will last, with its
neon signs, as least as much as the Alhambra. That cannot be said
about the rest of the red light districts in Granada. In the sixties
and before, it was the appropriately named
[Jazmín, or Jasmine, street, the one that concentrated the most whorehouses in Granada](http://www.ideal.es/granada/20090503/granada/atrincheradas-callejon-putas-20090503.html). And
the placement of this particular zone is curious. Most tenderloin
districts seem to be close to transit areas: harbors, train
stations. This one is smack in the middle of the city, meters away
from the city hall, and, well, army barracks. It is also very close to
one of the main churches in town, the Virgen de las Angustias, a
church often visited by old sex workers who were known by name:
[la Bizcocha](http://granadablogs.com/bizcocha/sobreelblo/), who
according to the Spanish Nobel Prize of Literature, Camilo José Cela,
was one of the most interesting characters in the city. Such an
interesting character probably did not exist, as mythical creatures
are wont to do: it was the
[name of a house](http://nito-lamurga.blogspot.com.es/2008/08/la-granada-golfa.html)
in the
[Manigua neighborhood](http://nuestragranada.blogspot.com.es/2010/10/los-restos-de-la-manigua.html),
a quarter that was razed to create the current Ganivet street, right behind the back of the current
police office. By extension, the manager of the bordello that
existed in the Bizcocha house until the sixties or maybe seventies was
also known under that name; managers were usually *retired*
prostitutes so maybe that is the origin of that nickname and,
probably, the legend. Like there were many legends about
[what happened in March 1994 in a whorehouse in that district](http://www.mapamemoriagranada.es/lugares/primer-franquismo/40-los-sucesos-de-la-calle-piedra-santa),
in the Piedra Santa (holy stone) street. Where, depending on who you
listen to, there was a base of guerrilla fighters opposing the Franco
regime and somebody ratted on them, or there was simply a place they
went often, or they were so unlucky as to be using their services at
the same time as one particularly vicious regime cop. Whatever the
case, at the end of the night a policeman and several *guerrilleros*
were dead. 

Those facts might have happened, in fact, in the Manigua, which has now disappeared, but some of these houses, and some
streets, can still be visited wandering around a quiet
neighborhood absent of any kind of catcalls and covered with graffiti,
which is other kind of local color. There is no sign there that
anything happened there, because
Granada is very fond of forgetting its own history, and here,
["whatever is permanent vanishes, and the ephemeral remains"](http://purpuranevada.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/tengo-hambre-mucha-hambre_5.html). Which
is probably bad, even if that history is, and maybe should be,
forgettable.
