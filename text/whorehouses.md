#Brothels and whorehouses

Let us be clear here. I am not encouraging you to visit *the inside* of this kind of places. You are obviously free to do so, and I will remain non-judgmental about it, but this chapter is not intended as an encouragement to the kind of behaviours that made this kind of establishments possible in the first place.

However, this is an off the beaten track kind of book. You must acknowledge that Lonely Planet does not include a *lewd* route in their otherwise excellent guides or that Fodor's gives one, two or three stars to kinky houses. So it is our turn to look at them from a cultural point of view and how they contribute to the overall image of the city.

First thing that characterizes them is neon. Since we are an old country, we do not care about this newish things that are the subject of [podcasts and history books elsewhere](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/tube-benders/). But most people and every truck driver in Spain knows that if that colored neon by the roadside is a milestone that indicates a place where you can get your rocks off. So to find them in Granada you will mostly have to drive and do it by night. There are a couple that are withing walking distance of the city itself, and they bear almost the same name: Don Pepe and Don JosÃ©. There quite a few more if you do some perfunctory search in Google, although maybe you should not do that; however, the first one run at one particular point in time radio ads, and the second one can be clearly seen if you travel South through the freeway in a strip mall between Granada and Armilla, right next to a wok buffet, a sporting goods store, and Toys'r'us. The usual place where you can find this kind of things, in short.

Would you want to go there and take a few pictures from the outside?

>If you do it, be discrete and if some burly dressed in black guy comes up to you, run back to your car and speed away.

Well, why not? Amsterdam red-light district, although at times looks like a Disneyfication of sexploitation, is a big attraction, the same as the Reeperbahn in Hamburg and other seedy places all over the world, including Times Square in the eighties. You can go, buy cheap sports t-shirts and then turn around the corner and sneak a picture of the neon signs, which, anywhere in the world, imply decadence and seedyness. A seedyness that is something to be proud off, but that can be otherwise put to work by creating alternative places to visit in the city. Which is what this book is all about.
