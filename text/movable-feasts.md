# Granada was a feast

Granada is a feast and most of them are anthropomorphic and move
around the city. Then there are the other religious holidays that move
around like Easter and Corpus Christi. These are sufficiently well
covered elsewhere, and if you have arrived here, you know that this
book is about exactly the opposite. So let us take a look at my very
own movable feasts.

## Blooming of the pink and white flowers.

If I knew anything about flowers, which I don't, I would tell you
precisely genus and species of these flowers which, as flowers are
wont to, smell pretty well.

## The flying white fuzz

## It's stag season

## The blooming of the Manolos

## Suitcase parade
