#Snow

For the average Joe-living-in-Granada, snow is something that happens
up there, in the mountains. You go there from time to time, maybe once
a year, maybe just when you realize your kid is seven year old and has
never seen the snow, to slide down slopes using ripped plastic bags or
trays or something equally dangerous. Sometimes you go just to lounge
off in one of the incredibly expensive ski resort cafés of Sierra
Nevada after parking your car in the incredibly expensive
parking. With global warming, it is increasingly difficult to have
natural snow even up there.

In the old days, snow was closer to the city itself, and it was mined
by people that took it down to the city for the well-off to cool their
drinks and their pantries. The muleteers that took the snow down from
the mountains were called *neveros*, or "snowers", and today there is
a street, "Camino de los Neveros", that follows that same route up to
the slopes of Sierra Nevada.

Nowadays it is something that
[you can do on a bike](http://josemerutass.blogspot.com.es/2007/01/camino-de-los-neveros-el-purche-los.html)
in a few hours with 90% of the time going up and 10% going down; it
would also be a 5 hour walk, more or less, 30 kilometers. But back
them, the
[names of the milestones along the way are witness to a hardscrabble business](http://www.magrama.gob.es/es/red-parques-nacionales/nuestros-parques/sierra-nevada/Camino_de_los_neveros_tcm7-311798.pdf):
Cuesta del Desmayo, "Fainting Slope"; Collado del Muerto, "Dead Man's
Hillock"; Collado de la Víbora, "Viper Hillock". Along the way, you
also find things like "Cerro Caparranas", which literally means "Frog
Castration Hill", and "Cerro de las Grajas", "She-rooks hill". Well,
you probably need to have a bit of fun around so much mayhem and
destruction.

Maybe the hard path and possible work-related injuries was the reason
why they traveled in [mule or donkey packs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XBQMznOVQ). The snow was extracted
from "neveros", which is also the name of more or less permanent snow
hollows, packed in wicker baskets and covered with blankets. Then it
was a long walk down to the city,
[usually by night ](http://www.nevasport.com/nivalis/art/1927/El-oficio-de-nevero/). However,
the most usual thing in Granada was that these working guys were
salaried workers. Snow trading, in an egregious exercise of what we
call now gating the countryside, was a monopoly that was given to the
best bid for a certain time. The person owning the trade usually had a
high social status and used this trade to make it higher. This
regulation persisted until the XIX century, with independent workers
taking the trade by the end of the century and selling it to ice
parlors and inns that used it for iced drinks and slushes.

This route can be easily followed nowadays. It starts in a
[suburb, Bola de Oro](http://es.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=979719).

Be aware that, as the instructions say, *there is no water along the
way*. One can imagine the snowmen drinking from their own medicine. Or
having a hard time on the way up if they forgot the water jugs and
imagining names for the places they were going through. 

The end of the snowmen arrived in 1920, when electricity allowed the
creation of ice factories, the first one in 1922. Although after some
time, in the 50s hospitals and cafés, due to blackouts after the civil
war, had to create a fleet of trucks that traveled up to the mountains
to get the ice and bring it down. Mules, horses and donkeys were lost
forever, along with the muleteers that guided them down those paths. 

The sight of snow in the streets of Granada was also lost. Nowadays it
is something that happens rarely. One every few years. It happened
yesterday, and will probably not happen for a few more years. But when
it does  it is all look at that roof with snow, loot at that car with
snow, oh, it is stopped snowing, see you in half a dozen years. 

Anyway, when it happens, there are many ways of enjoying the snow
which you can only do in Granada: 

* Walk up the slippery slopes in the Albayzín and fall down one, or several, times.
* A few days after, realize there is a river going through Granada and that it was not a parking lot with a somewhat big puddle.
* Take pictures of the Alhambra, which is red, with a bit of pink of top.
* Walk about in your snow attire that you could show off only when you took your kid to meet the snow a few years prior.

This chapter ends here. It need not be longer since the probability
that you will actually see the snow in Granada is next to nil. So no
need to spend valuable chapter space with it. Let us be done with it
and proceed to the next chapter.
