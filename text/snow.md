#Snow

For the average Joe-living-in-Granada, snow is something that happens
up there, in the mountains. You go there from time to time, maybe once
a year, maybe just when you realize your kid is seven year old and has
never seen the snow, to slide down slopes using ripped plastic bags or
trays or something equally dangerous. Sometimes you go just to lounge
off in one of the incredibly expensive ski resort cafés of Sierra
Nevada after parking your car in the incredibly expensive
parking. With global warming, it is increasingly difficult to have
natural snow even up there.

In the old days, snow was closer to the city itself, and it was mined
by people that took it down to the city for the well-off to cool their
drinks and their pantries. The muleteers that took the snow down from
the mountains were called *neveros*, or "snowers", and today there is
a street, "Camino de los Neveros", that follows that same route up to
the slopes of Sierra Nevada.

Nowadays it is something that
[you can do on a bike](http://josemerutass.blogspot.com.es/2007/01/camino-de-los-neveros-el-purche-los.html)
in a few hours with 90% of the time going up and 10% going down; it
would also be a 5 hour walk, more or less, 30 kilometers. But back
them, the
[names of the milestones along the way are witness to a hardscrabble business](http://www.magrama.gob.es/es/red-parques-nacionales/nuestros-parques/sierra-nevada/Camino_de_los_neveros_tcm7-311798.pdf):
Cuesta del Desmayo, "Fainting Slope"; Collado del Muerto, "Dead Man's
Hillock"; Collado de la Víbora, "Viper Hillock". Along the way, you
also find things like "Cerro Caparranas", which literally means "Frog
Castration Hill", and "Cerro de las Grajas", "She-rooks hill". Well,
you probably need to have a bit of fun around so much mayhem and destruction. 


But down here? Not so often. One every few years. It happened
yesterday, and will probably not happen for a few more years. But when
it does  it is all look at that roof with snow, loot at that car with
snow, oh, it is stopped snowing, see you in half a dozen years. 

Anyway, when it happens, there are many ways of enjoying the snow
which you can only do in Granada: 

* Walk up the slippery slopes in the Albayzín and fall down one, or several, times.
* A few days after, realize there is a river going through Granada and that it was not a parking lot with a somewhat big puddle.
* Take pictures of the Alhambra, which is red, with a bit of pink of top.
* Walk about in your snow attire that you could show off only when you took your kid to meet the snow a few years prior.

This chapter ends here. It need not be longer since the probability
that you will actually see the snow in Granada is next to nil. So no
need to spend valuable chapter space with it. Let us be done with it
and proceed to the next chapter.
