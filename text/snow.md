#Let it snow

For the average Joe-living-in-Granada, snow is something that happens
up there, in the mountains. You go there from time to time, maybe once
a year, maybe just when you realize your kid is seven year old and has
never seen the snow, to slide down slopes using ripped plastic bags or
trays or something equally dangerous. Sometimes you go just to lounge
off in one of the incredibly expensive ski resort cafés of Sierra
Nevada after parking your car in the incredibly expensive
parking. With global warming, it is increasingly difficult to have
natural snow even up there. That is why watching the weather forecast
is like an spectator sport down here. It is usually very monotonous:
sunny, sunny, and then a bit more sun, with temperatures that might
span 20 degrees in a single day because sun, but when in winter and
morning temperatures dropping below zero you always look for the snow
level. Granada sits at around 700 meters, 680 meters, in fact, so when
rain and below zero, there you have it, snow in Granada. Those are two
different things,
however. [Granada is one of the provincial capitals in Spain with least rain, 400 mms/year](http://javiersevillano.es/PrecipitacionMediaAnual.htm#provincia)
and then, see above re: temperature span, and even if it rains, it has
to do so in the dead of night or at dawn to meet the low temperatures
that produce snow.

Temperatures are increasing and rainfall dropping year on year with
global warming, a concept that hit the ground here even before it  was all over the
Internet and, indeed, before the Internet was all over the place. The
[FIS Alpine World Ski Championship 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships_1996)
was slated to take place, well, in 1995. However, it was an unusually
dry and warm year; I remember it was one of the only years in my life
when water was rationed and we could only use a few hours a day. It
was the year I organized the European Conference on Artificial Life
and my new car was stolen, so when I arrived home all frazzled and
sweaty I still had to wait for a while until water sputtered out of
the taps. Anyway, just imagine the guys all dressed up in colorful ski
attire and no joy. So It was postponed to the next year, 1996, which,
besides, was a great year for snow. That did not help any Spaniard hop
to the podium, but you cannot have it all. Since 1982, it is the only
[ski championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alpine_skiing_world_champions)
that took place in an even year. Only one in Spain, too. 

The organizers should have realized, much before that, that snow is
not so close to the city as it used to be. In the old days, you needed
not go so far away from Granada, which sits at 700 meters of altitude, and it was mined
by people that took it down to the city for the well-off to cool their
drinks and their pantries. The muleteers that took the snow down from
the mountains were called *neveros*, or "snowers", and today there is
a street, "Camino de los Neveros", that follows that same route up to
the slopes of Sierra Nevada.

Nowadays this route is something that
[you can do on a bike](http://josemerutass.blogspot.com.es/2007/01/camino-de-los-neveros-el-purche-los.html)
in a few hours with 90% of the time going up and 10% going down; it
would also be a 5 hour walk, more or less, 30 kilometers. But back
them, the
[names of the milestones along the way are witness to a hardscrabble business](http://www.magrama.gob.es/es/red-parques-nacionales/nuestros-parques/sierra-nevada/Camino_de_los_neveros_tcm7-311798.pdf):
Cuesta del Desmayo, "Fainting Slope"; Collado del Muerto, "Dead Man's
Hillock"; Collado de la Víbora, "Viper Hillock". Along the way, you
also find things like "Cerro Caparranas", which literally means "Frog
Castration Hill", and "Cerro de las Grajas", "Hen-rooks hill". Well,
you probably need to have a bit of fun around so much mayhem and
destruction.

Maybe the hard path and possible work-related injuries was the reason
why they traveled in [mule or donkey packs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-XBQMznOVQ). The snow was extracted
from "neveros", which is also the name of more or less permanent snow
hollows, packed in wicker baskets and covered with blankets. Then it
was a long walk down to the city,
[usually by night ](http://www.nevasport.com/nivalis/art/1927/El-oficio-de-nevero/). However,
the most usual thing in Granada was that these working guys were
salaried workers. Snow trading, in an egregious exercise of what we
call now gating the countryside, was a monopoly that was given to the
best bid for a certain time. The person owning the trade usually had a
high social status and used this trade to make it higher. This
regulation persisted until the XIX century, with independent workers
taking the trade by the end of the century and selling it to ice
parlors and inns that used it for iced drinks and slushes.

This route can be easily followed nowadays. It starts in a
[suburb, Bola de Oro](http://es.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=979719).

Be aware that, as the instructions say, *there is no water along the
way*. One can imagine the snowmen drinking from their own medicine. Or
having a hard time on the way up if they forgot the water jugs and
imagining names for the places they were going through. 

The end of the snowmen arrived in 1920, when electricity allowed the
creation of ice factories, the first one in 1922. Although after some
time, in the 50s hospitals and cafés, due to blackouts after the civil
war, had to create a fleet of trucks that traveled up to the mountains
to get the ice and bring it down. Mules, horses and donkeys were lost
forever, along with the muleteers that guided them down those paths.

Now that route is followed more often by
[camouflaged cars](http://www.bmwfaq.com/threads/de-pruebas-de-coches-pillados-en-sierra-nevada-granada.622877/). Not
only the road to Sierra Nevada is one of the highest in Europe, it is
also a few hours' drive away from the seaside, where temperatures
might be 30 degrees higher, not to mention the difference of
pressure. That is why it is quite usual to find on the road leading to
the airport and up in the Sierra cars with everything but the license
plates and some windows covered with a black-and-white canvas that
sometimes looks like camo and some other times like a psychedelic 60's
dress. These tests
[usually take place on weekdays](http://www.ideal.es/granada/provincia-granada/201407/27/secretos-altura-sierra-nevada-20140726204405.html)
and you are advised to post your pictures in forums for car
aficionados so that they can find out what brand they are.

I hope that these curious car spottings are not lost, but the sight of
snow in the streets of Granada is impossible to know how much it will last. Nowadays it
is something that happens rarely. Once every few years. It happened
the day before I wrote this, there are some spots the day I am
correcting it, and will probably not happen for a few more years. But when
it does  it is all look at that roof with snow, loot at that car with
snow, oh, it is stopped snowing, see you in half a dozen years. 

Anyway, when it happens, there are many ways of enjoying the snow
which you can only do in Granada: 

* Walk up the slippery slopes in the Albayzín and fall down one, or several, times.
* A few days after, when snow melts, realize there is an actual river going through Granada and
  that it was not a parking lot with a somewhat big puddle. 
* Take pictures of the Alhambra, which is red, with a bit of pink of top.
* Walk around the place in your snow attire that you could show off only when you
  took your kid to meet the snow a few years prior.

By the time you read this, there might not be any glaciers in Sierra
Nevada either. You might be surprised that, up in the Veleta or
Watchtower, the highest peak in Sierra Nevada, there was a small
glacier, El Corral del Veleta, that held snow the year
round. Ice was over the ground until the XIXth century, and since then
it was [underground](http://ireneu.blogspot.com.es/2015/10/glaciar-veleta-sierra-nevada.html). But [it has been melting](http://www.geocritiq.com/2013/10/el-hielo-glaciar-de-sierra-nevada-continua-derritiendose/)
at a increasing pace, and probably also due to the operation of the
snow cannons and the heat they generate in the Sierra itself. You
always get something, lose something in the process. Maybe forever. 

This chapter ends here. It need not be longer since the probability
that you will actually see the snow in Granada is next to nil. So no
need to spend valuable chapter space with it. Let us be done with it
and proceed to the next chapter.
