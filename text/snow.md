#Snow

For the average Joe-living-in-Granada, snow is something that happens up there, in the mountains. You go there from time to time, maybe once a year, maybe just when you realize your kid is seven year old and has never seen the snow, to slide down slopes using ripped plastic bags or trays or something equally dangerous. Sometimes you go just to lounge off in one of the incredibly expensive ski resort cafés of Sierra Nevada after parking your car in the incredibly expensive parking. With global warning, it is increasingly difficult to have natural snow even up there. 

But down here? Not so often. One every few years. It happened yesterday, and will probably not happen for a few more years. But when it does  it is all look at that roof with snow, loot at that car with snow, oh, it is stopped snowing, see you in half a dozen years.

Anyway, when it happens, there are many ways of enjoying the snow which you can only do in Granada:

* Walk up the slippery slopes in the Albayzín and fall down one, or several, times.
* A few days after, realize there is a river going through Granada and that it was not a parking lot with a somewhat big puddle.
* Take pictures of the Alhambra, which is red, with a bit of pink of top.
* Walk about in your snow attire that you could show off only when you took your kid to meet the snow a few years prior.

This chapter ends here. It need not be longer since the probability that you will actually see the snow in Granada is next to nil. So no need to spend valuable chapter space with it. Let us be done with it and proceed to the next chapter.
