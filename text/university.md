#The best university in Granada

>There is only one university in Granada. So that thing above is a joke. Laughs accepted. Thanks.

Granada is an university city, thanks mainly to the [UGR](http://ugr.university), which is one of the biggest in Spain and includes more than fifty thousand students. In a city with five times that population, that implies that Granada lives and breathes through its university.
