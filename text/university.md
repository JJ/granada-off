#The best university in Granada

>There is only one university in Granada. So that thing above is a joke. Laughs accepted; in fact, they are compulsory. Thanks.

Granada is an university city, thanks mainly to the
[UGR](http://ugr.university), which is one of the biggest in Spain and
includes around fifty thousand graduate students or eighty thousands
if you include postgraduates and people taking any kind of class. In a
city with a population roughly five the number of graduates, that implies that Granada lives
and breathes through its university. And that is literal in a sense:
[almost 5% of the provincial income stems from the university](http://www.ideal.es/granada/v/20120503/granada/motores-granada-20120503.html)
and eleven thousand jobs, which is 3.5% of the total employment in the
province. 

>And, full disclosure, it provides a day job for me. 

That living and breathing has happened for some time now, being also one of the oldest universities in Spain, so this is bound to have an impact on the city landscape. However, most of it is *in* the beaten track. 

So, off the top of my head, and outside that in-the-beaten track fact
that some buildings are old and Gothic and venerable, university
buildings are great resources for a couple of things: WiFi and
restrooms. 

>In fact, I am big fan of universities everywhere for the sanitary
>services they provide. When touristing, I always follow the old adage
>"Do your number ones when you can, not when you want" so if you pass
>by an university building, just walk confidently in and look for the
>toilettes, in the corridor straight ahead and to your left. You might
>not end up in the aforementioned lavatories, but you will probably
>find somebody helpful who will direct you to them. 

Other than that, why would you want to go to the university? For
starters, it might go to you instead. There are several campus

>*Campi*? *Campuses*? *Campa*? 

and
then independent buildings all over the city. *Ciencias*, for instance, is in a big campus
called Fuentenueva which is close to the city center. Two faculties,
Translation and Law, are independent, and old, and nice, buildings
very close to downtown and the other monuments. Other campus,
Aynadamar, houses the closely related Fine Arts and Computer Science,
while Cartuja houses the also closely related Pharmacy, Psychology,
Library Science, Dentistry, 
Marketing and Humanities. The recently built and even more recently opened Bio-Health campus includes
several high rises where Nursing and Medicine is taught, as well as a
big, and very recently opened, hospital, the morgue and several research
campuses. It is really unlikely that you end up, by mistake, in the
Faculty of Sports Sciences, but if you visit the Gothic structure of
the Hospital Real, you can be seen from the windows of the university
president office. 

The university cafeterias are also good reasons for visiting any of
them. The *café con leche* is often awful, and myth says that in
occassions number-twos inducing, but also awfully cheap, and there
is great, funny and knowledgeable company. Every one of them has a
library where old and dusty tomes are housed, and you can go through
while you hide from the heat, or the rain, or if you actually are looking for a
particular book. Check out
[the catalog](http://biblioteca.ugr.es/pages/catalogo) in
advance. Places like the Fine Arts or the Letters and
Humanities libraries house a good amount of contemporary literature
and essays, the Architecture school has a incredible collection of,
you guessed it, Architecture books, including some amazing PhDs texts that
you will not be able to find anywhere else.

Plus you might want to visit the university colleges because they house some jewels that are
missed because they are, just like the rest of this book, off the
beaten track. Check out, for instance, the Cartuja Campus. It hosts,
except for Pharmacy, which will be moving eventually, mostly non-science or engineering degrees, and
you can notice the atmosphere is much more relaxed and corridors much
more crowded that the ones in Ciencias or Computer Science. If you are
into interminable discussion that start with coffee and end somewhere
you do not really know how you got, this is your place. Besides, their
cafeterias, being on a hill, offer some of the best views in
Granada. The one in the Faculty of Psychology has one of the best
sunsets in Granada, plus excellent company. The Faculty of Economics
has also an excellent outdoor terrace with very nice views of the
city. And the cafeteria in Pharmacy is in a school with one of the
highest female rate and, at the same time, the highest number of
students in Granada. From there, the Odontology and Communications
schools share the
[Colegio Máximo](http://fcd.ugr.es/pages/facultad/colegio), originally
a Jesuit novitiate, but now a monastery-like place with old printing
machines in the corridors, low cost dental clinic and also a beautiful
*neomudéjar* chapel that you will probably be able to visit if you ask
nicely in reception; it is completely empty but its Moorish revival
decoration, stained glass windows and shell-like baptismal font are
really remarkable and could be an incredible background to a rave
party. The whole building, even if not ancient, is
[remarkable](http://lastresgranadas.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/colegio-maximo-de-los-jesuitas-en.html)
and was one of the first Jesuit buildings in the area that eventually
included a lot. If you are *in* the beaten track and visiting the
Cartuja, which is five hundred meters away, take a small detour and
visit this place too. And the cafeteria has an outdoor terrace in the
cloister. Monument-wise, it is difficult to beat that in Granada.

>Just remember the living and breathing thing. School days go from
>September first to mid-July. Exams start in early June, or in late
>May when the university calendar changes in the near future, so
>September to May are the best dates to visit. Except for number ones
>or twos, the best date and time being always when you can. 

University dorms are not the kind of place the common Granadino lives in, and
they might look like hospitals or churches or some other thing from
the outside. But
the university also includes places people, not from Granada, actually live in, and they
are the quintessential examples of traditional houses where real
people, from Granada, lived in ancient times. One of them is
[the Carmen de la Victoria](http://carmendelavictoria.ugr.es/), which
is an example of a [Carmen](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_granadino), basically a villa within the confines of
the city of Granada, but more often in the Albayzín or Realejo,
sometimes in the Barranco del Abogado. As the Carmen website offers,
Carmen comes from the Arab *karm* which means vineyard; that was the
name that orchards around the city received around the time when the
Alhambra was built. There are many cármenes around the city, which
makes the Albayzín seen from above a group of green patches quite
different from what you see at street level: whitewashed walls and
dark alleys. Some of
them can be visited, but this one, besides having a incredibly nice
view of the Alhambra, also hosts many cultural events: movie
screenings, poetry readings, and even scientific meetings. If you are
visiting a colleague in the University of Granada, the only possible
way of spending a night there, ask for a reservation well in advance
and, if possible and money allows, ask for the suite, which has a
balcony with the Alhambra in direct line of sight. The scenery there
at dawn is just stunning. If you are not so lucky, you can take a walk
in the 100-year old gardens, which were built in a way that was
traditional by the end of the XIX century and which you can see also
in places like the Carmen de los Mártires, this one open to the
public, and filled with peacocks. 

The other university residence corresponds to a more modest dwelling: the
[Corrala de Santiago](http://corraladesantiago.ugr.es/). A *corrala*
is a shared house organized around a central yard. Families lived in
one or a few rooms, and the patio centralized some services: sometimes
an outhouse, most of the times a well. Very few corralas have
survived, and most of them are private and cannot be visited. This one
is rather open, but is also the place where a *Cruz de mayo*, or May
cross, is erected during that particular celebration. What a "cruz de
mayo" is kind of difficult to explain, but let us say it is a cross
with many other things on the side.

>I will probably talk about them when I write the chapter on movable
>feasts. This particular one is not movable by itself, but people move
>around a lot during its celebration.

The yard is surrounded by galleries at all levels, and these
galleries are supported by columns taken from the most diverse places,
other demolished buildings or buildings that would be demolished after
some smartass took its columns from it. In fact, there is a
[whole movement around the concept of Corrala](https://granadastopdesahucios.wordpress.com/2013/11/17/surge-la-primera-corrala-en-granada-el-triunfo/),
and related to stopping evictions, and it eventually came to Granada. The Corrala el Triunfo can now be
visited and has been occupied by a group of persons intent on giving
an alternative to people that has been evicted. They, themselves, were
evicted but if you check out their website you will probably be able
to find their activities.

Going back to the Corrala de Santiago, you might take advantage also
of cultural activities taking place there to have a look at it. It is
in the middle of the Realejo area, in a small alley, with many
graffiti around. The Realejo is definitely worth the while, and maybe
deserves a whole book.

The corrala de Santiago also has an exhibition area with works of art
from local artists, mainly students. And it is only a sample of what
you can see in the University.

Because there is art here, and Art with a capital A. The university
holds yearly contests for rewarding the master works of its best students, and the
prize is being a part of the Modern Art Collection of the University
of Granada. If there is an index to that collection, I have been
unable to find it. However, having been involved with the university
for a few years, I know that paintings, photographs and sculptures end
up in offices, corridors and stairs anywhere. There are three in the
[free software office](http://osl.ugr.es), and feel free to come and appreciate them. We
would happily give them to you, since they leave us a bit like this
:-?, uncultured geeks as we are, only we cannot, because they are art
and belong to the humankind in general, not me or you. In fact, one of
those pieces of art that looked like a irregular block of concrete
with jagged iron bars coming out from it spent a long time as an
ashtray in the old Computer Science school. The staff had to
specifically instruct the cleaning crew to neither use it as a dustbin
or carry it to a dumpster as a piece of debris. Which, I guess,
eventually became since it disappeared one day, not to be seen again
until I found it in the Computer Science library, serving as a
pedestal for stuff.  

I am not saying that they are not incredibly talented master works; it
is quite clear that all of them are, since most of them have won the
prize. Only since I have not been able 
to find a catalog
[except for this one](http://patrimonio3d.ugr.es/index.php/granada/pintura),
which apparently lists only more classic works and not the modern
ones, I cannot point out which ones are good enough for you or where
they are, my dear reader. 

A set of piedes that is easily available in any faculty is this one:
If you walk into the administrative area or close to the lecture halls 
you will be unable to avoid the pictures with the former deans,
dressed with the classic university attire, one that I have been
unable to avoid wearing just a couple of times, during a Honoris Causa
celebration. 

>There are just a few of these every year, and they are the University
>as its best. If you get the chance, attend to one for a while. Only
>you do not get to use the attire with the funny hat. *I* get to use
>it. 

Just so
you know, the color of the band, which for some reason is called beca,
same name as for grants in Spanish, depends on the degree or maybe
doctorate you obtained. I go with blue, I think, although I am not
sure, since blue is for Sciences and I am actually in an engineering
school. Never mind. These guys will be looking their best with
academic robes. I leave as an exercise for the reader to find out
which is the dominant age and genre and how it varies from one Faculty
to the next one. 

Because every Faculty is its own little world and is not so much a
cross section of the Spanish society as a sample of a particular
intellectual, attitudinal and economical status. Check out Medicine,
for instance, which is now housed in its very own white high rise, one
you can see from the ring road. It needs an almost perfect grade to
enter, close to 99%. It is the creme of the crop coming out of high
schools in Granada which you can see there. Check out Fine Arts,
too. Or Sports Sciences. They have to pass an special exam, besides
requiring high grades in their A-levels, or Selectividad, which is its
equivalent in Spain. We even have a Theology school, which, to tell
you the truth, I have never visited. But back to Fine Arts, it is
really worth a visit. Their library is excellently stocked with all
kinds of media and arts texts, including Marshall McLuhan, if you care
about him. The building was a former madhouse
built at the turn of the century, although the reforms and decoration
include a couple of graffiti walls on the back. If you are in need of
art supplies, it has a *economato* or student discount store where you can buy
all kind of brushes, drawing pads and stuff needed for artistry. Its
main building includings an exhibition space used for works of arts by
students and faculty. 

And once you are there, you can walk up the street to the other side
of the roundabout with the olive tree in the middle and visit the
[ETSIIT](http://etsiit.ugr.es), which was also an important part of the geek 
chapter. Or use it as a warm-up to know about graffiti in Granada,
since Fine Arts is at its core. I have spent quite a few paragraphs on
the geek contents of the ETSIIT, but in this chapter I would like to
remark a few things. First, its great library for all things geek. If
you need a book on some obscure or obsolete programming language, it is probably
here. For instance, the great and big "The art of computer
programming", which Donald Knuth has spent a whole life writing and
will probably do so for years to come. It is one of the few colleges
that have an alfresco gathering room; you can see people lounging and
writing code and gaming almost all year round in the area to the left
of the main gate. And to the right and almost hidden
by the prefabricated units and the proverbial trees, [there is a small forest created by the trees](https://www.flickr.com/photos/atalaya/149900614) planted by every outgoing promotion of alumni. It is quite small
indeed, but you will see a set of different trees, which might number
20 or so, since the first promotion graduated in 93. A curious
souvenir and maybe a metaphor that computers not only save trees from
death by eliminating the need of paper, but also plant them for good
measure. 

For political consciousness and painted slogans on paper rolls, go
back to the city center and check
out Political Sciences, which goes together with Sociology, or back to
Cartuja and go to the Humanities faculty, which houses the dozen of
students of Philosophy. There are always political
assemblies or organized protests going on there. But if you are more
into economics, check the ecosystem that has evolved around the
Faculties. Having a sparse campus has spread the wealth it brings to
the city and there are all kinds of shops that cater to students:
bookstores, cafés, copy shops, supplies... If you walk to the
Architecture School, which is in the middle of El Realejo,
[a former military hospital and house of the Admiral or Aragón built in the XVI century](https://prezi.com/r-rgq3hih_22/el-hospital-militar-de-granada-antiguo-palacio-del-almirant/),
which lots of people in the region remember because it was where young
ones with the age to serve where parked when they alleged some kind of
ailment to be rid of the military service, has evolved from bleak and
drab barracks to a
[functional, bright and light building that has received an architecture price](https://minutosdearquitectura.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/premio-arquitectura-2015-para-la-rehabilitacion-del-antiguo-hospital-militar-de-granada-de-victor-lopez-cotelo/),
which is turning a former traditional and touristic neighborhood into
a vibrant student area. Architecture, with its grim job outlook,
accompanies now the
[Modern Languages Center](https://www.clm-granada.com/) in the neighborhood, which is not strictly
University but university-owned. 

>Yes, it is complicated. But never mind, it quacks and walks and swims
>like an university, so let us just let it be.

This place is the closest to an American-style college you will find
here, mainly because the bulk of its students, coming here to learn
Spanish, hail from the United States. That means flip-flops any time
of the year, Jansport backpacks, and walking Styrofoam cups from
coffee-to-go places that cater precisely to this crowd and nobody
else, since any self-respecting Spaniard will have a proper sit-down
coffee with an olive-oiled toast on the side.

And probably the best place in the university to have one of those
coffees, Spanish style, is the
cafeteria in the Faculty of Law. It opens to the
[Botanic Garden](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jard%C3%ADn_Bot%C3%A1nico_de_la_Universidad_de_Granada)
so you can sip your capuccino and enjoy the sights, too. Besides, this
is the oldest university building in Granada, if you exclude the
Madrassa or Islamic University by the side of the cathedral, which you
might or might not want to do if you want to make this university the
oldest in Europe or not. The botanic garden itself was created in the
XIX century as a subject of study. Just look at the tallest tree,
which is a Ginkgo biloba, the only one in the province for a long
time, or look back to the building itself, that
[houses the university from pretty much the same time](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultad_de_Derecho_de_la_Universidad_de_Granada#Historia_de_la_Facultad). It
was built in the XVI century and called
[Colegio de San Pablo](http://www.jesuitas.es/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=937:el-retablo-del-antiguo-colegio-jesuita-de-san-pablo-en-granada&catid=34:jesuitas-espana&Itemid=63). It
was a school belonging to the Jesuits and
[one of the main centers for Latin studies in Granada](https://books.google.es/books?id=txtt7QLOUQUC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=%22colegio+de+san+pablo%22+granada&source=bl&ots=bFduBN76P1&sig=7qx1APQlqhq_CEpSCPXg4Si0FuM&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx8PSks43KAhUChhoKHUoMDT0Q6AEIYTAN#v=onepage&q=%22colegio%20de%20san%20pablo%22%20granada&f=false),
another example, as the Colegio Máximo, of the university taking over
from the Jesuits, and a continuity note since current students use
Latin too to say stuff like "Habeas Corpus" and "Gaudeamus
Igitur". Some of them, at least. 

Finally, for a glimpse of he future, visit the gleaming and spanking
new Biosanitary campus, which started to be used at the beginning of
the first semester of the 2015-2016 course. It is white, it has
high-rises, and the professors hated it and all but went on strike
before being forced to occupy it: It was too far away from their
private practices,
clinics and home offices, it did not have enough parking space, it had
a single bus line going through it. It does have nice light rail
stations, but no actual light rail, so no joy for the time being. Be that as it may, it
is now working and surrounded by research centers and weed-filled
empty lots, so it kind of looks like the kind of place zombie fighters
might go looking for a cure in a post-apocalyptic world. In fact, the
main city morgue is part of the campus, so if that zombiepocalypse
eventually happens is the most likely
place that kind of thing will begin.
But it is evolving and there might no weeds, or chest-high ones, by
the time you read this.

One of the most beautiful things there are the graffiti. A famous
local graffiti artist, 

>More on him on its very own chapter, or a chapter devoted to

Niño de las Pinturas, was commissioned to paint all its utility
shacks. It is worth a visit just for that reason. 

>In fact, it can be the starting point for a interesting graffiti route.
