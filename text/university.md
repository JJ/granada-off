#The best university in Granada

>There is only one university in Granada. So that thing above is a joke. Laughs accepted. Thanks.

Granada is an university city, thanks mainly to the [UGR](http://ugr.university), which is one of the biggest in Spain and includes more than fifty thousand students. In a city with five times that population, that implies that Granada lives and breathes through its university.

Off the top of my head, and outside the in-the-beaten track fact that some buildings are old and Gothic and venerable, they are great resources for a couple of things: WiFi and lavatories.

>In fact, I am big fan of universities everywhere for the sanitary services they provide. When touristing, I always follow the old adage "Pee when you can, not when you want" so if you pass by an university building, just walk confidently in and look for the lavatories, in the corridor straight ahead and to your left.

Other than that, why would you want to go to the university? For starters, it might go to you instead. There are several campus and then independent buildings. Ciencias, for instance, is in a big campus called Fuentenueva which is close to the city center. Two faculties, Translation and Law, are independent, and old, and nice, buildings very close to downtown and the other monuments. Other campus, Aynadamar houses the closely related Fine Arts and Computer Science, while Cartuja houses the also closely related Pharmacy, Psychology, marketing and humanities. The recently built Health campus includes several high rises where Nursing and Medicine is taught, as well as a big, and so far unfinished, hospital, the morgue and several research campuses. It is really unlikely that you end up, by mistake, in the Faculty of Sports Sciences, but if you visit the Gothic structure of the Hospital Real, you can be seen from the windows of the university president office.

The university cafeterias are also good reasons for visiting any of them. The *caf√© con leche* is awful but also awfully cheap, and there is great, funny and knowledgeable company. Every one of them has a library where old and dusty tomes are housed, and you can go through while you hide from the heat or if you actually are looking for a particular book. Check out [the catalog](http://biblioteca.ugr.es/pages/catalogo) in advance. Places like the Fine Arts library or the Letters and Humanities house a good amount of contemporary literature and essays.

Plus you might want to go because they house some jewels that are missed because they are, just like the rest of this book, off the beaten track.
