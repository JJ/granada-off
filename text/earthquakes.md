#Earthquake!

Yes, there are earthquakes from time to time in Granada. What? There
are big ones in Japan and San Francisco and no one refrains from going
there to do a bit of sightseeing, right?

We had one
tonight. [It was a big one, by any measure: 6.3 in the Richter scale](http://www.02.ign.es/ign/layoutIn/geofisicaCuestionarioMacrosismico.do). As
you know, this scale is logarithmic, which means that one point more
means that it is 10 times as big. So 6 is, well, rather big. This one,
however, was in the middle of the sea, closer to Melilla, one of the
Spanish cities in Africa, than to Granada.

Even so, we were awakened by a rocking bed, and we live in a first
floor. So I can imagine people living in the 10th floor or doing so in
Málaga, closer to the earthquake. And I can also imagine people living
in Fear of Missing the Earthquake, or FOMTE. It is that kind of
event. You meet your people the next day, and they are all, yes, wow,
it was the couch, or the bed, or the rocking chair, rocking, or all,
maaaan, I was sound asleep, I missed it. Fortunately they are the
hashtag-producing and conversation-inducing kind, not the massive
destruction kind.

Not that there have not been a few of that kind in the past. Biggest
one in living memory took place
[in 1956 between Atarfe and Albolote](http://iagpds.ugr.es/pages/informacion_divulgacion/terremoto_atarfe_albolote_1956),
North of Granada but just a few kilometers away. Magnitude was
just 5.0 but it was time ago. Nowadays it would have just caused a
quick check of Twitter and back to bed, but several people died, some
of them living in caves that collapsed. It produced a few damages in
Granada proper: chimneys falling down, cracks in walls, things like
that. [The regime newsreel, NoDo, featured it under the headline "Havoc and catastrophes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzYloQhlVk8).

The big one happened long ago, in 1884, and it was so big that it was
called
[the Andalusian earthquake](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terremoto_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa_de_1884),
although its epicenter was in the province of Granada, in Arenas del
Rey, a small town close to the Málaga border. More than 800 people
died, 104 of them in Albuñuelas del Valle. That city, along with
Arenas del Rey, were razed and they had to be rebuilt. In fact, it was
Juan Montserrat y Vergés, who was mentioned in the chapter on
freemasonry, the main architect of this reconstruction, which was
funded by the ministry but also by the city of Barcelona. This
earthquake happened in December and it was followed by snowfall, which
greatly affected all people that had been left homeless.

Fortunately, we are a bit more prepared for that and, as it happens in
California,
[building code includes a certain amount of reinforcement](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_de_Construcci%C3%B3n_Sismorresistente)
in areas with high seismicity, such as Granada and Málaga. In fact, the
zone with the highest sismicity protection is East of Granada, in
Santa Fé, the city you go across on your way from Seville, Málaga or
the airport. 

In the time of the Alhama earthquake, the problem of getting help was
aggravated by the fact that everyone thought that 
Andalusian people were overdoing it, drama queen style. You know, we
are always boasting, Andalusia is the bigger this and the funnier
that. That was not the case, but it delayed help for some time.

That is why in these enlightened times we do exactly the
opposite. "Earthquake, really? I thought my roommate was
farting". That should be your attitude if it happens to you.
