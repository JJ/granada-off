# Memes, physical and otherwise

Whatever city in the world you are in, there is bound to be some
phenomenon, or artifact, that is exactly the same as in any other
place in the world. All touristic places are becoming instances of a
*Worldiana* (as in Americana, you know), and Granada has been carried
away in the stream. For instance, there is no place in the world where
you cannot buy a t-shirt with the motto "My buddy was in X and all I
got was this [lousy T-Shirt](http://selfindulgence.org/List_of_items_with_the_phrase_and_all_I_got_was_this_lousy_T-shirt)", or black postcards with the legend "X by
night".

Let us start by one of the most famous and misunderstood:
[sneakers in power lines](http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/sneakers.asp). Nobody
knows where it started, nobody knows why it started to be acknowledged
as a sign of "Drugs sold here", but we know that it ended in Granada
in several places. You can find several pictures
[in Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cottonmouth2010/4481868029/in/photolist-7Q3KdH),
but the main places where you find them is those in which cables are
in a low enough position to be reached by a non-professional
shoe-tosser, that is, narrow streets with low-hanging power lines
like those in the Magdalena neighborhood, the Realejo or even the
Albayzín.
