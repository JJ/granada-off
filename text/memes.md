# Memes, physical and otherwise

Whatever city in the world you are in, there is bound to be some
phenomenon, or artifact, that is exactly the same as in any other
place in the world. All touristic places are becoming instances of a
*Worldiana* (as in Americana, you know), and Granada has been carried
away in the stream. For instance, there is no place in the world where
you cannot buy a t-shirt with the motto "My buddy was in X and all I
got was this [lousy T-Shirt](http://selfindulgence.org/List_of_items_with_the_phrase_and_all_I_got_was_this_lousy_T-shirt)", or black postcards with the legend "X by
night".
