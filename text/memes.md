# Memes, physical and otherwise

Whatever city in the world you are in, there is bound to be some
phenomenon, or artifact, that is exactly the same as in any other
place in the world. All touristic places are becoming instances of a
*Worldiana* (as in Americana, you know), and Granada has been carried
away in that stream. For instance, there is no place in the world where
you cannot buy a t-shirt with the motto "My buddy was in X and all I
got was this [lousy T-Shirt](http://selfindulgence.org/List_of_items_with_the_phrase_and_all_I_got_was_this_lousy_T-shirt)", or black postcards with the legend "X by
night".

>To tell you the truth, I have not checked you can actually buy those

>Alcaicería, where all those things should be and sometimes are, and
>check if that is actually true. After reading the chapter on malls,
>of course. What the hell, you have probably been there already. *In*
>the beaten track. Shame on you!

So let us dive right in with  by one of the most famous and misunderstood memes:
[sneakers in power lines](http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/sneakers.asp). Nobody
knows where it started, nobody knows why it started to be recognized
as a sign of "Drugs sold here", but we know that it ended in Granada
in several places. You can find several pictures
[in Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cottonmouth2010/4481868029/in/photolist-7Q3KdH),
but the main places where you find them is those in which cables are
in a low enough position to be reached by a non-professional
shoe-tosser, that is, narrow streets with low-hanging power lines
like those in the Magdalena neighborhood, the Realejo or even the
Albayzín. You will not find them in the wide avenues such as Camino
Ronda or the Gran Vía.

And talking about the Gran Vía, very recently and years after the
first edition of this book, a Starbucks opened where before there was
a clothes shop. We have not arrived yet to the
Starbucks-in-every-corner level, and it's relatively unlikely we'll
ever reach that. After all, there's a bar or a café almost in every
corner already, and they serve cheap, if not always good, coffee. So
that might prove to be a hard nut to crack.

Some other memes, like the Thai massage which I have found in
Budapest, Vienna, and everywhere, has not yet made it to Granada. And
that I don't understand. Is Granada less than those European capitals?
Or maybe it's considered more culturally appropriate to open a hammam?
We have a bunch of those, and of course simple spas.

Another meme we have been unable to escape are the
bolts-tied-to-bridges, which apparently started with a book, and in
Rome. So many things start in Rome. The lack of bridges with the
proper place to lock bolts might have been one of the reasons. Most
bridges in Granada are made of stone, and the meme does not go so far
as to have to hammer a ring in it and *then* tie the bolt. Eventually,
a bridge with the desired characteristics was found in the general
area of the Parque de las Ciencias; if you go across the river from
there in the direction of the city center, you will see some bolts
tied, mostly, for some reason, in the left hand side of that
bridge. Why did that start to happen? An educated guess is that
someone left a bike tied to the bridge, bike that was subsequently
stolen leaving just the bolt. Thus start memes.

Coins in fountains? We do have that in the Alhambra, but that's
outside the scope of this book. We don't have that many fountains, and
those that we have are not at the proper height to watch your coin
sink and lay there, by the Mexican peso and the Moroccan
dirham. That's a matter that will have to be investigated by the
tourism commission. No city is a proper tourist city without a
coin-tossing fountain.

Some other memes are circumscribed to a single country. No matter
where you are in Spain, you are supposed to drink sangría and eat
paella. Words to the wise: don't.
