# The emerging phenomenom of the *kasbah*

Walking up the Elvira street, which is kind of the boundary between
the *real* and the *unreal* city, you might find a sign pointing to
the *kasbah*. It signals what the local people call "Calle de las
teterías", or teashop streets, and everyone Calle Calderería Nueva, or
Boiler factory street.

It is undoubtedly a colorful and lively, although completely fake,
place. Walking up the street you will find a teashop in every other
door, and souvenirs and arab bakeries in between. By the end of the
street people meet in the steps leading up to the top of the Albayzing
all kind of people smoking all kind of things, juggling and
drinking. Also the San Gregorio cloistered convent which is open at odd hours, and
where you can listen to the nuns chanting in special occasions. All in
all, an ersatz Arab kasbah, except for the nuns, that is. 

There are many interesting things to see around there. Take the
darkest alleys and you will find, up Zenete street, one of the most
spectacular graffiti and also views of the cathedral. Check out the
pedestrian floors, created as a pebble mosaic, with all kind of
geometric motifs. It is also [completely fake](http://www.granadahoy.com/granada/empedrado-historico-Albayzin_0_650035186.html), with a motif dating back
to the last century, probably 1984 when the city major decided to pave
all the streets in the Albayzin, but the patterns and texture are original,
created with black and white pebbles and simply nice to see for the
same reason that they are terribly inconvenient for people that lives
there, a curious mixture of old timers with no place else to go and
apartment dwellers coming from all parts of the world.
