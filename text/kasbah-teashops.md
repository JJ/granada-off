# The emerging phenomenon of the *kasbah*

Walking up the Elvira street, which is kind of the boundary between
the *real* and the *unreal* city, you might find a sign pointing to
the *kasbah*. It signals what the local people call "Calle de las
teterías", or teashop streets, and everyone Calle Calderería Nueva, or
Boiler factory street.

It is undoubtedly a colorful and lively, although completely fake,
place. Walking up the street you will find a teashop in every other
door, and souvenirs and Arab bakeries in between. By the end of the
street people meet in the steps leading up to the top of the Albayzín
all kind of people smoking all kind of things, juggling and
drinking. Also the San Gregorio cloistered convent which is open at odd hours, and
where you can listen to the nuns chanting in special occasions. All in
all, an ersatz Arab kasbah, except for the nuns, that is. 

There are many interesting things to see around there. Take the
darkest alleys and you will find, up Zenete street, one of the most
spectacular graffiti and also views of the cathedral. Check out the
pedestrian floors, created as a pebble mosaic, with all kind of
geometric motifs. It is also [completely fake](http://www.granadahoy.com/granada/empedrado-historico-Albayzin_0_650035186.html), with a motif dating back
to the last century, probably 1984 when the city major decided to pave
all the streets in the Albayzín, but the patterns and texture are original,
created with black and white pebbles and simply nice to see for the
same reason that they are terribly inconvenient for people that lives
there, a curious mixture of old timers with no place else to go and
apartment dwellers coming from all parts of the world.

Even if it is exactly on the beaten track, it is worth the while to
wander there, maybe early in the morning, when all you will see is
people walking down to their jobs, children with their backpack on
wheels making a racket in the street pebbles, maybe some bakers
opening the doors to their establishment, letting out a waft of warm
and scented air smelling of flour and crispy bread. Although, to tell
the truth, that is as likely as the scent of marijuana produced by
people returning at that time to their places. Anyway, it will be
easier to see the origin of this place: halfway up the street and to
the left, the tetería Alfaguara was actually the origin of it all
during the eighties.

Back then, before the Albayzín was considered World Heritage, tourists
mostly went to the Alhambra and that was Granada for then. No
touristic apartments, no low-cost weekend escapades, nothing like
that. Teashops were as exotic as gastrobars and there were only a
couple of them: one in the Camino the Ronda, which was kind of
political and intellectual and a place to take a date if you wanted to
look smart, and the Alfaguara, which was romantic, cozy, with rather
expensive teas, but definitely the place to go, maybe after you had
exhausted all the beer ant tapas place and maybe as a starter to the
more hardcore pubs, like the Enano Rojo, in that area. Being quite
outside the universitary geography in the eighties, it was not exactly
popular, but you could take exotic teas and smoothies although
everyone ordered the Pakistani, with a hint of cinnamon, since the
rest were either too exotic or presented too many unknowns (Cardamom?
Really?). Besides being the oldest in the place, there is also more
history behind it,
from
[labor conflicts](http://archivo-periodico.cnt.es/290may2003/gacetasindical/archivos/gs001.htm) to
[employees skimming the cash register](http://www.granadahoy.com/granada/Piden-acusada-quedarse-recaudacion-teteria_0_533046953.html). 

The other shops came later, one by one and two by two, and I really do not know exactly when, but
in the late nineties, the *kasbah* was a thing. At the same time,
*real* tea shops started to be opened in Granada. And I am a tea
person, so if you really want to taste flavorful, loose leaf tea, try
one of them, although my favorite is Granada Tea, which happens to be
in the city center. Teashops are great places to visit in any part of
the world. The atmosphere, the smell, the tranquility of the place,
the knowledge of the person tending the shop are all something to tap
and to enjoy. To tell you the truth, this one is not one of the best I
have ever been. Many teashops have big caddies in shelves or in
tables, and, by them, little caddies that you can open to smell the
tea. This particular one has no problem opening the cans and letting
you smell them, and I encourage you to do so. But you can smell the
teas as soon as you open the door. I was there yesterday, and there
was a hint of cinnamon in the air. Talking to Miguel, the owner, he
told me that the smell varied with the seasons and the kind of teas
people ask him to serve: it is usually cinnamon in the winter, more
spicy and minty during summer. 

You should really go there for the tea. Buy a couple of bags, take a
walk up the Calderería and then go back to your house or apartment and
browse the pictures you have taken while you enjoy a great, warm,
flavorful tea made with your own hands. It is what I do and, hey, you
wanted to do as the locals, right?
