#Malls, suburban and otherwise

Before there were even malls, there were *passages*, covered alleys filled with shops of many kinds. There were quite a few of them in Granada, and I used to visit them to buy, for instance, model planes or just to check out the immense variety of model trains and ships and wonderful stuff I might build, which I sometimes did, and hanged on the ceiling, and they woke me up once crashing down to the floor to become a pile of plastic pieces. All shops in that passage [closed in 2013](http://granadaimedia.com/la-decadencia-de-la-galeria-de-ganivet/), shuttering the last vestige of those galleries in Granada. 

You can still walk the Alcaicería, the most fake of *authentic* places
in Granada. Between the Zacatín street and the cathedral, there is a
small regular grid of alleys filled with shops selling souvenirs made
in China and managed by authentic people from Granada born
elsewhere. You can still visit one, maybe two, places where authentic
local woodcraft, called *taracea*, is made and sold; however, the best
ones have moved to Elvira street, which looks pretty much the same,
with shops hanging their wares all around their doors, except you have
to dodge cars and marijuana smoke. 

This Alcaicería, whose name stems actually from Caesar, which in Arab
sounds the same way as in German, *kaiser*, is supposed to evoke the
bustle and spirit of an old bazaar. I fact, it is placed where the
*suq* bazaar was originally, although the real one spanned from what
is now Plaza Nueva to the Bib-Rambla square, which is actually the
limit now to this new one. And I say *placed* because it was actually
built in the 1840s, after what was left of the original one burned to
the ground. Somebody commissioned
[José Contreras](http://www.ugr.es/~compoarq/compoarq_archivos/profesores/jmbarrios_archivos/Mis%20publicaciones%20PDF/2010-Jose_Contreras_pionero_arquitectura_neoarabe-JMBarriosRozua.pdf),
who had worked in the Alhambra, to design and build this all new
Alcaicería, from scratch. In doing so he all but invented the
[Moorish revival or neo Arab style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_Revival_architecture),
at the same time building one of the [first commercial
arcades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall#Development_of_shopping_areas_and_building_types)
and most certainly one of the first in Europe. It took a long time to
take off, however. The 1908 Baedeker's guide to Spain and Portugal
mentions "a market hall (little used)", but no wonder, since the city
is described as a "sad" city or a "living ruin", where a "large
proportion of the population subsists by begging alone". That was
probably not the case, but it is the impression you can get if you
visit a place, like this, populated almost exclusively by people
making a living out of tourists. Nobody from Granada will ever adventure further than Zacatín to buy anything there.

Anyway, that is beaten track central, and you are not looking for
that in this book, but for the exact opposite in whatever direction
you choose. You might then want to check out
*Centro Comercial Neptuno*, which is a real, actual, modern, shopping mall, and is within walking
distance of the city center, and is practically haunted, with most
shops closed down and just a movie theater and a few bars surviving
from tweens meeting and millennials taking their kids to run there
when it is a foul day. It was the first mall ever opened in Granada,
not so long ago, as a response by local merchants to the onslaught
brought by the big department stores, Hipercor and Carrefour. These
can declare victory now without a doubt, because most shops have moved
back to the city or gone into oblivion, maybe looking for one of the
other malls that have opened all around the city. 

The final strike was the opening or yet other, bigger and better,
malls in some other places. First came Kinépolis, North of the city,
with a cineplex and Carrefour as its main poles of attraction. Then
came the curiously spelled Alhsur, South of the city and close to the
living quarters of many granadinos. Then came Serrallo Plaza, modern,
gleaming, more movie theaters, and that was the clinch, a Mercadona
and a Zara. You could shop for groceries, buy a tee, go to the movies
and then have something to eat in one of the franchises in the main
hall. Besides, these were local franchises, the Burger King relegated
to a corner of the hall, so you could feel patriotic in the middle of
an American-style space.
