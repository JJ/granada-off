# Malls, suburban or not

Before there were even malls, there were *passages*, covered alleys filled with shops of many kinds. There were quite a few of them in Granada, and I used to visit them to buy, for instance, model planes or just to check out the immense variety of model trains and ships and wonderful stuff I might build, which I sometimes did, and hanged on the ceiling, and they woke me up once crashing down to the floor to become a pile of plastic pieces. All shops in that passage [closed in 2013](http://granadaimedia.com/la-decadencia-de-la-galeria-de-ganivet/), shuttering the last vestige of those galleries in Granada. 

You can still walk the Alcaicería, the most fake of *authentic* places
in Granada. Between the Zacatín street and the cathedral, there is a
small regular grid of alleys filled with shops selling souvenirs made
in China and managed by authentic people from Granada born
elsewhere. You can still visit one, maybe two, places where authentic
local woodcraft, called *taracea*, is made and sold; however, the best
ones have moved to Elvira street, which looks pretty much the same,
with shops hanging their wares all around their doors, except you have
to dodge cars and marijuana smoke. 

This Alcaicería, whose name stems actually from Caesar, which in Arab
sounds the same way as in German, *kaiser*, is supposed to evoke the
bustle and spirit of an old bazaar. I fact, it is placed where the
*suq* bazaar was originally, although the real one spanned from what
is now Plaza Nueva to the Bib-Rambla square, which is actually the
limit now to this new one. And I say *placed* because it was actually
built in the 1840s, after what was left of the original one burned to
the ground. Somebody commissioned
[José Contreras](http://www.ugr.es/~compoarq/compoarq_archivos/profesores/jmbarrios_archivos/Mis%20publicaciones%20PDF/2010-Jose_Contreras_pionero_arquitectura_neoarabe-JMBarriosRozua.pdf),
who had worked in the Alhambra, to design and build this all new
Alcaicería, from scratch. In doing so he all but invented the
[Moorish revival or neo Arab style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_Revival_architecture),
at the same time building one of the [first commercial arcades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall#Development_of_shopping_areas_and_building_types)
and most certainly one of the first in Europe. It took a long time to
take off, however. The 1908 Baedeker's guide to Spain and Portugal
mentions "a market hall (little used)", but no wonder, since the city
is described as a "sad" city or a "living ruin", where a "large
proportion of the population subsists by begging alone". That was
probably not the case, but it is the impression you can get if you
visit a place, like this, populated almost exclusively by people
making a living out of tourists. Nobody from Granada will ever adventure further than Zacatín to buy anything there.

Anyway, that is beaten track central, and you are not looking for
that in this book, but for the exact opposite in whatever direction
you choose. You might then want to check out
*Centro Comercial Neptuno*, which is a real, actual, modern, shopping mall, and is within walking
distance of the city center, and is practically haunted, with most
shops closed down and just a movie theater and a few bars surviving
from tweens meeting and millennials taking their kids to run there
when it is a foul day. It was the first mall ever opened in Granada,
not so long ago, as a response by local merchants to the onslaught
brought by the big department stores, Hipercor and Carrefour. These
can declare victory now without a doubt, because most shops have moved
back to the city or gone into oblivion, maybe looking for one of the
other malls that have opened all around the city. 

The final strike was the opening or yet other, bigger and better,
malls in some other places. First came Kinépolis, North of the city,
with a cineplex and Carrefour as its main poles of attraction. Then
came the curiously spelled [Alhsur](http://www.alhsur.com/),

>Just realized in might have something to do with the *Alh*ambra. As if...

South of the city and close to the
living quarters of many granadinos. Then came Serrallo Plaza, modern,
gleaming, more movie theaters, and that was the clinch, a Mercadona
and a Zara. You could shop for groceries, buy a tee, go to the movies
and then have something to eat in one of the franchises in the main
hall. Besides, these were local franchises, the Burger King relegated
to a corner of the hall, so you could feel patriotic in the middle of
an American-style space. 

>Since Serrallo Plaza opened, I have never returned to Alhsur. You can
>actually *walk* to Serrallo from the city center, walking up the
>Avenida de Cervantes. And check out other
>haunted mansions and some graffiti along the way, so have those
>chapters handy. 

The only way to go to Alhsur is to ride your own car. There might be
public transportation, as in metropolitan buses that ply the route
Granada-La Zubia, but if you intend to spend some time there and get
out late at night, you better bring your own ride. A taxi back to
Granada might cost you a few dozens euros. And, well, in fact, there
is nothing there that is worth the while. It is a bog-standard neat
little mall, with balconies all along it, and franchises in the
middle, a cineplex at one end, and a supermarket in the other. For a
time, it was the only place where you could buy Dunkin Donuts in
Granada, but it closed and there is one now downtown. It is not even
interesting in the anthropological sense. That area houses
upper-middle class homes, besides the locals, which might be
increasingly less in a town that was, some time ago, mainly devoted to
agriculture. The town itself might be worth a visit, if only because
it is not in any touristic guide, but only if you have checked in
already in all the other places in this and Lonely Planet's book.

The other two malls might have some anthropological interest, due to
the diverse mixture of people that their geographical position
offers. Kinépolis is close to the poorest parts of Granada, and it is
more a leisure than a shopping center. It is rather far from
everything, although its movie theaters are among the best, and the
only place where you can watch some movies in their original
version. Serrallo is quite fashionable since it opened, and has a
great mixture of a leisure area together with nice shopping
franchises. It is preferred by couples with small children, who you can
see pursuing their toddlers riding on plush-mobiles and looking
bored. It usually shows Granada matches in the big screen, so it might
be as good a place as any other to disappoint yourself and see other
people disappointed following one of the most disappointing, if
resilient, teams of the First Division in Spain which, for unknown
reasons, somebody call *La Primera Liga*, when the *Liga* is the whole
set of divisions. This mall is also within walking distance of the
soccer stadium, so it is a good stopover in the way from or to a
match; even if you are not attending, the show of team shirts and spirit
is worth the while and probably one of the few places in the world
where you can contemplate football team supporters without being in
any kind of danger.

The last mall, the Nevada, is the largest, the most controversial and, for the time
being, the one that has been closed for the longest time, since it
took some space from the tram right-of-pass, was stopped by the
regional government, apparently illegally, so it will have to be
[reimbursed to the tune of a few hundred million euro](http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2016/07/15/578931c7268e3edd6b8b46b0.html). Maybe
by the time you read this it will be opened, since it is slated to
start
[by November 2016](http://www.granadadigital.es/el-centro-comercial-nevada-tiene-prevista-su-apertura-el-11-de-noviembre/). If
eventually it opens as planned, it will be the place to go, with a
FNAC, a Primark, and most probably a huge traffic jam to get there if
the tram is not working, which it will not until maybe 2017.
