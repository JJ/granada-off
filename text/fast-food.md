#Fast food

You already know about *tapas*. They are (usually) fast enough, although the racket is to take enough bringing the tapa so that when it arrives you are already done with your bear and you order the second. And then they can skimp on the last one. Happens all the time, just do not go back to the place and bash it in Tripadvisor.

Besides that, there are several local equivalents of fast food joints.

>And I do not mean here local pizza or donuts or cronuts or wok franchises. I mean the real deal, born and raised in Granada.
