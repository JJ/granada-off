# Fast food

You already know about *tapas*. They arrive (usually) fast enough,
although the racket is to take enough time to bring the tapa to your
table so that when it arrives you are already done with your bear and
you have to order the second to wash it down. Then they can skimp on
the last one, when you are ready to go and just want the bill. Happens
all the time and in many places, just do not go back to the place and bash it in
Tripadvisor. 

Besides that, there are several local equivalents of fast food joints.

However, before we go into El Pollo Frito de Kentuquio, let me tell you something about the *tapas*, besides what has
already been said. They are not *that* fast. 

And it is like that for a good reason. Just look at the economics of
the free tapa with the drink. Look at the costs. The beer is almost
free, actually. Most bars stock a
single or a couple of different beers on tap, it has a high
rotation. Besides, it is served in bite sizes: the *caña* is 1/5 or 1/6 liters,
or 1/3rd if you ask for a *tubo* or *copa*, but the cost of the liquid itself
will hover around 10 cents.

This means that when you are buying a drink, you are actually paying
for the tapa. The tapa also has the most added value, but also bears
most of the cost. This means that if you skip a tapa you will be paying the two
odd euros for something that costs a few cents.

That is why tapas are not so fast. Mind you, they are *way* faster than a
proper sit down meal. But it is in the interest of the (mean) bar
owner to extend as much as possible the period between serving the
beer and actually serving the tapa if only he has some passing
interest in economics. Which, being Granada as it is the *tierra del
chavico*, the land of the (untranslatable coin which would be
equivalent to one eighth of a peseta, *ochavico* being a diminutive of
*ochavo*, or one eighth), meaning people from Granada are known for
being thrifty (to put it mildly), he will probably be.

Plus tapas are usually salty and greasy things that give you
thirst, and it is a feature, not a bug, that they arrive at the tail
end of your glass of beer, so very 
often you will order *another* beer when the tapa for the first is
arriving to chase it down.

This means that you have to choose and choose well when you want your
Spanish fast food to be really fast, and not
slightly-faster-than-very-slow. Fortunately, there are many places
like that in Granada, and we might have a chapter for that, too. 

So, once it has been established that some tapas joints, mainly catering to
tourists, are not so fast, let us get to the genuine local fast-food joints, places that
serve sandwiches and that will get you fixed in no time, as long as
you do not mind to eat standing up and with minimal support for your
beer and elbows. In fact,
since these places are usually less crowded, and more accessible, that
the MacKings and Montana Fried Turkeys, they are the go-to places before
going to the theater, yes, we have that from time to time in Granada,
or to the movies or if you have the munchies any time of the
day or night. Places like the
[Frankfurt's Bocanegra](https://www.tripadvisor.es/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g187441-d6131741-i89527252-Frankfurt_s_Bocanegra-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html),
with several types of hot and cold sandwiches and show cooking, which
means that the grill is right there and you can watch your beacon
simmer while you sip, just a bit, your beer. Places like
[Bar Aliatar](http://baresautenticos.com/2010/09/24/bar-aliatar/) with
many types of sandwiches, most of them based on pork, or
[Bodegas la Mancha](http://baresautenticos.com/2012/10/15/bodegas-la-mancha/),
where you can taste an artichoke sandwich which will make you want to
turn vegetarian. Not me. I hate artichokes. But since you are reading
this book by a no-name dude, you are probably open to new experiences,
so you will probably want to do that.

You will probably want to taste the modern versions of the global
staples: pizza, kebab and burgers. There are some Italian food franchises
which serve the first, but many *croasanterias* (literally,
*croissant* shop) and even bakeries will sell you warm, and a bit
limp, pizza slices for a few euros. I particularly like "La Ibense",
if only because it is placed next to a bus stop and you can literally
buy a pizza in the time you transfer from one bus to the next; that
also means that they fly quite fast so you might even get it warm
directly from the oven; there are places like this one all over the
city, just follow the burnt cheese smell.

Burgers are a different matter altogether. 

Good thing about this is the cost: less than five euros for a sandwich
plus the beer. Depending on the sandwich, you will have some change
left for coffee. Which you will want to take elsewhere, of course;
these places are really focused on turning sandwiches as fast as
possible and do not have the space, or time, to prepare you a *café
con leche*.
