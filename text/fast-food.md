#Fast food

You already know about *tapas*. They are (usually) fast enough, although the racket is to take enough bringing the tapa so that when it arrives you are already done with your bear and you order the second. And then they can skimp on the last one. Happens all the time, just do not go back to the place and bash it in Tripadvisor.

Besides that, there are several local equivalents of fast food joints.

However, let me tell you something about the *tapas*. They are not
fast. At all.

And it is like that for a good reason. Just look at the economics of
the free tapa with the drink. Look at the costs. The beer is almost
free. And it is like that for several reasons. Most bars stock a
single or a couple of different beers on tap, it has a high
rotation. It is served in bite sizes: the *ca√±a* is 1/5 or 1/6 liters,
or 1/3rd if you ask for a *tubo*, but the cost of the liquid itself
will hover around 10 cents.
