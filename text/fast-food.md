#Fast food

You already know about *tapas*. They are (usually) fast enough, although the racket is to take enough bringing the tapa so that when it arrives you are already done with your bear and you order the second. And then they can skimp on the last one. Happens all the time, just do not go back to the place and bash it in Tripadvisor.

Besides that, there are several local equivalents of fast food joints.

However, let me tell you something about the *tapas*. They are not
fast. At all.

And it is like that for a good reason. Just look at the economics of
the free tapa with the drink. Look at the costs. The beer is almost
free. And it is like that for several reasons. Most bars stock a
single or a couple of different beers on tap, it has a high
rotation. It is served in bite sizes: the *ca√±a* is 1/5 or 1/6 liters,
or 1/3rd if you ask for a *tubo*, but the cost of the liquid itself
will hover around 10 cents.

This means that when you are buying a drink, you are actually paying
for the tapa. The tapa also has the most added value. But also the
cost. This means that if you skip a tapa you will be paying the two
odd euros for something that costs a few cents.

That is why tapas are not so fast. Mind you, they are faster than a
proper sit down meal. But it is in the interest of the (mean) bar
owner to extend as much as possible the period between serving the
beer and actually serving the tapa.

Plus tapas are usually salty and greasy things that give you
thirst. And they arrive at the tail end of your glass of beer, so very
often you will order *another* beer when the tapa for the first is
arriving to chase it down.

This means that you have to choose and choose well when you want you
Spanish fast food to be really fast, and not
slightly-faster-than-very-slow. Fortunately, there are many places
like that in Granada.

And then there are the genuine local fast-food joints, places that
serve sandwiches and that will get you fixed in no time, as long as
you do not mind to eat standing up and with minimal support for your
beer and elbows. In fact,
since these places are usually less crowded, and more accessible, that
the MacKings and Montana Fried Turkeys, it is the place to go before
going to the theater, yes, we have that from time to time in Granada,
or to the movies or if you have the munchies any time of the
day. Places like the
[Frankfurt's Bocanegra](https://www.tripadvisor.es/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g187441-d6131741-i89527252-Frankfurt_s_Bocanegra-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html),
with several types of hot and cold sandwiches and show cooking, which
means that the grill is right there and you can watch your beacon
simmer while you sip, just a bit, your beer. Places like
[Bar Aliatar](http://baresautenticos.com/2010/09/24/bar-aliatar/) with
many types of sandwiches, most of them based on pork, or
[Bodegas la Mancha](http://baresautenticos.com/2012/10/15/bodegas-la-mancha/),
where you can taste an artichoke sandwich which will make you want to
turn vegetarian. Not me. I hate artichokes. But since you are reading
this book by a no-name dude, you are probably open to new experiences,
so you will probably want to do that.

Good thing about this is the cost: less than five euros for a sandwich
plus the beer. Depending on the sandwich, you will have some change
left for coffee. Which you will want to take elsewhere, of course.
