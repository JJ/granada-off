Granada Off
===========

Granada Off the Beaten Track, a set of experiences you should not miss on your third or fourth visit.

## Why

When I started this book, I had been living in Granada for thirty years. Every day I walk to my day job or walk about to vent off I try to follow a new path or double a corner to a street I have never been before, I find new graffiti, a derelict house that is derelicter or a statue that very few people have seen and even less care about. And I have always thought, one day I will have to write about this, and do it in English, just because.

## The title

This book might be called Granada hacks. It might still be, in some
future edition. *Hacks* is the title of a series of books that tell you how to use programming languages, or whatever (there is even a Mind Hacks) in ways you had not thought about before. This book will be more or less the same. It will tell you how to live and experience and do Granada (and maybe somewhere else) in a new way.

## You got me. But will you speak about the Alhambra?

I should, should I not? It is unavoidable, but there are excellent books to learn about its history and its art and its legends. So while it is going to be impossible to avoid, in principle there will be no Alhambra hack. Or maybe I should make it the first one to get it out of the way and continue with the rest.

## But, again, why?

Lately I have been hanging around in [Quora](http://quora.com) and they ask all kinds of stuff about Spain, Granada, and I keep answering them in a haphazard way. With this, I intend to answer and then point them to this repo and/or the Kindle book that will result from it.

Besides, this has all been an exercise of knowing thyself, or whatever equivalent of that ancient word is there for the firsr person. Or rather of knowing thy city. I hava had to research lots of parts, which has led me to understand a bit more of the history of my city. Which is, to a point, my very own history.


## Instructions for use

Granada is an old place. Like, incredi-fucking-old. It was an Iberian city, the Iberians being the tribe that populated Spain in the first millenium BC, but it has also traces of Phoenician, Carthaginian, wow, that was hard, Roman, possibly Jewish and of course the Arab and Christian that is the one you see. There is little left of those secret origins but names: Elvira street takes its name from Iliberri, Iberian name, possibly meaning (city) by the river, and Illiberis, Roman name, taken from that. The current name is probably more related to the pomegranate fruit than to anything else, although it could be also [Gar-Anat, or Hill of the Strangers or the Pilgrims](http://www.madregot.com/Sefarad.htm) in Hebrew, or maybe [Karnattah or Karnattah-al-Yahud](http://www.britannica.com/place/Granada-Spain), meaning pretty much the same in "Moorish", or in Arab [according to the 1911 edition of the same encyclopedia](http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/g2/granada_spain_capital.html) or maybe something completely different [in Phoenician](https://books.google.es/books?id=HHlZpX0XVEwC&pg=PA369&lpg=PA369&dq=karnattah&source=bl&ots=TzY2lMQo0m&sig=8O_3f9yYr0P9NOTIvGAFkTEV11Q&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix3Kui8orKAhXLuBQKHRenD_Q4ChDoAQgeMAA#v=onepage&q=karnattah&f=false) related to gods or kings.

If it is already difficult to narrate the origin of the name, it might be impossible to create a narrative for the city. That is why have not tried to thread the different parts of this book. I really doubt there is one, a city and the people that live in it are just there, and same as there is not a single route to visit the city, there is no single history that can be told around experiences and objects in a particular city like Granada. So after reading the tips that are in the first chapter, you can jump around from one section to the next, or read just a few lines and start exploring the city using Lonely Planet, only please come back here afterwards. If you want, of course. Use this book as a path for creating your own narrative of the city, as a conduit for having epiphanies in some lost alley or corner that will anchor your recollections and that will help you meet yourself. Because every travel can be an inner travel, if you just have the right guidance.

The text has also lots of hyperlinks inserted. If your ebook reader includes a browser, feel free to follow them in the same spirit as before. Unluckily, I have not been able to find English references for everything, but I have provided them whenever possible. They are mostly sources for what I am talking about, so if you think ""What the heck is this guy saying" by all means click on them and rest assured that the outrageous lie that is written on the page is confirmed by at least another outrageous complicit.

That does not mean that this book is not intended for actual browsing in dead tree form; that form is a good vehicle for showing your love to a dear friend who will visit Granada or who you intend to leave green with envy after your own visit to Granada. Both are valid and endorsed by this author.

I really encourage you to email me or reach out to me in Twitter for suggestions, criticism, compliments and, of course, to correct mistakes of which there must be quite a few. As a self-published author without the luxury, and also the burden, of an editor, I must rely on kind strangers to provide me with help in these matters. Only if you have acquired this book you will no longer be a stranger. You will keep being kind, I hope.
