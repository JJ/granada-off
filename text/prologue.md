Granada On
===========

Granada Off (and sometimes on) the Beaten Track, a set of experiences you should not miss on your third or fourth visit.

## Why

When I started this book, I had been living in Granada for thirty years. Every day I walk to my day job or walk about to vent off I try to follow a new path or double a corner to a street I have never been before, I find new graffiti, a derelict house that is derelicter or a statue that very few people have seen and even less care about. And I have always thought, one day I will have to write about this, and do it in English, just because.

## The title

This book might be called Granada hacks. It might still be, in some
future edition. *Hacks* is the title of a series of books that tell
you how to use programming languages, or whatever (there is even a
Mind Hacks) in ways you had not thought about before. This book will
be more or less the same. It will tell you how to live and experience
and walk Granada (and maybe somewhere else) in a new way.

But you might have bought it as *Granada On*, which is kind of
meaningless, but better than *Granada Off*, short for "Granada off the
beaten track" but a title that, no pun intended, might put you off
buying it.

But I still do not like it very much; it looks a lot like
[On Granada](http://www.ongranada.com/en/), the local Chamber of
Commerce program for attracting IT businesses here. So in future
editions Granada will be on, but on will be probably off.

>And it was worth the while to have that title just for the purpose of
>being able to make that joke. 

## You got me. But will you speak about the Alhambra?

I should, should I not? It is unavoidable, but there are excellent
books to learn about its history and its art and its legends. So while
it is going to be impossible to avoid, in principle there will be no
Alhambra chapter. Or maybe I should make it the first one to get it out
of the way and continue with the rest. Whatever comes out, just keep
reading to find out.

## But, again, why?

Lately I have been hanging around in [Quora](http://quora.com) and
they ask all kinds of stuff about Spain, Granada, and I keep answering
them in a haphazard way. With this, I intend to answer and then point
them to this repo and/or the Kindle book that will result from it. 

Besides, this has all been an exercise of knowing thyself, or whatever
equivalent of that ancient word is there for the first person. Or
rather of knowing thy city. I have had to research lots of parts,
which has led me to understand a bit more of the history of my
city. Which is, to a point, my very own history.

But if you are asking why I am doing this in English, when it is so
not my mother tongue, well, it looked like a good idea when I
started. You know, writing for expats and all that. Most tourists that
come to Granada are from, you know, not here and speak in tongues.

But I guess that the main thing is that most of the material I have
been using, and linking from the main text, is not in English. So, in
some cases, references to facts or biographies or explanations might
not be available elsewhere. So someone, eventually, might profit from
this material available in English, I guess. 

Last time I wrote a whole novella in English and published it managed
to make all of half a dozen sales. So this one will probably fail
spectacularly. 
I might eventually decide to translate it into Spanish. Or into better
English. Whatever I find the time and will to do first. Maybe I will
just huddle in a corner and cry quietly. Or go out and enjoy, once
again, Granada.


## Instructions for use

Granada is an old place. Like, incredi-fucking-old. It was an Iberian
city, the Iberians being the tribe that populated Spain in the first
millenium BC, but it has also traces of Phoenician, Carthaginian, wow,
that was hard, Roman, possibly Jewish and of course the Arab and
Christian that is the one you see. There is little left of those
secret origins but names: Elvira street takes its name from Iliberri,
Iberian name, possibly meaning (city) by the river, and Illiberis,
Roman name, taken from that. The current name is probably more related
to the pomegranate fruit than to anything else, although it could be
also
[Gar-Anat, or Hill of the Strangers or the Pilgrims](http://www.madregot.com/Sefarad.htm)
in Hebrew, or maybe
[Karnattah or Karnattah-al-Yahud](http://www.britannica.com/place/Granada-Spain),
meaning pretty much the same in "Moorish", or in Arab
[according to the 1911 edition of the same encyclopedia](http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/g2/granada_spain_capital.html)
or maybe something completely different
[in Phoenician](https://books.google.es/books?id=HHlZpX0XVEwC&pg=PA369&lpg=PA369&dq=karnattah&source=bl&ots=TzY2lMQo0m&sig=8O_3f9yYr0P9NOTIvGAFkTEV11Q&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix3Kui8orKAhXLuBQKHRenD_Q4ChDoAQgeMAA#v=onepage&q=karnattah&f=false)
related to gods or kings. 

If it is already difficult to narrate the origin of the name, it might
be impossible to create a narrative for the city. That is why have not
tried to thread the different parts of this book. I really doubt there
is one, a city and the people that live in it are just there, and same
as there is not a single route to visit the city, there is no single
history that can be told around experiences and objects in a
particular city like Granada. So after reading the tips that are in
the first chapter, you can jump around from one section to the next,
or read just a few lines and start exploring the city using Lonely
Planet, only please come back here afterwards. If you want, of
course. Use this book as a path for creating your own narrative of the
city, as a conduit for having epiphanies in some lost alley or corner
that will anchor your recollections and that will help you meet
yourself. Because every travel can be an inner travel, if you just
have the right guide. 

The text has also lots of hyperlinks inserted. If your ebook reader
includes a browser, feel free to follow them in the same spirit as
before. Unluckily, I have not been able to find English references for
everything, but I have provided them whenever possible. They are
mostly sources for what I am talking about, so if you think ""What the
heck is this guy saying" by all means click on them and rest assured
that the outrageous lie that is written on the page is confirmed by at
least another outrageous complicit. 

That does not mean that this book is not intended for actual browsing
in dead tree form; that form is a good vehicle for showing your love
to a dear friend who will visit Granada or who you intend to leave
green with envy after your own visit to Granada. Both are valid and
endorsed by this author.

In any way you acquire the book, it has not been written to be read
sequentially. Most chapters refer by name to other chapters, so you
can hopscotch your way from one to the other or read a bit here and
there. In that sense, it is better if you use the book and carry a
bunch of Post-Its with you to bookmark the many places where you left
a particular chapter. You can also use them for doodling the graffiti
you meet along your way or to take notes reminding you to send any
corrections and suggestions to this author. I will thank you very much
indeed. 

I really encourage you to email me or reach out to me in Twitter for
suggestions, criticism, compliments and, of course, to correct
mistakes of which there must be quite a few. As a self-published
author without the luxury, and also the burden, of an editor, I must
rely on kind strangers to provide me with help in these matters. Only
if you have acquired this book you will no longer be a stranger. You
will keep being kind, I hope.
