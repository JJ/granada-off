#Castles in danger

Spain and Granada have got their share of McMansions and what we could call suburban kitsch. During the early 2000s, the real estate bubble created big developments from places where only shrubbery was found before but, in some cases, it did not do it fast enough and got caught by the bubble bursting.

Peligros, which literally means Dangers, is a small city at the North of Granada; somebody decided that castles would look great in mockups and in real estate leaflets and built a whole street of them. You can see [the twin towers from the sky](https://www.google.es/maps/place/Peligros,+Granada/@37.2365652,-3.6153554,226m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0xd71fd84e437cbf3:0x7f40ab84465b1e30?hl=es), two whole rows of them, with swimming pools acting as moats only they are on the back and they would defeat no enemy other than decaying property values and, pun intended, underwater mortgages.

They actually are, at least this year, in the middle of nowhere, as if they were going to stand a siege, surrounded by neat streets with neat names but almost no houses. That is great for parking space and probably for creating great infancy moments, but probably not for garbage collection and, again, property values.

At [street level](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.2360526,-3.6158829,3a,75y,58h,78.75t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1shapbexZ3eyam5EqG-OHxYQ!2e0?hl=es) they do look impressive if abandoned, most windows shuttered, almost no sign of actually having been occupied. Nice view to the snowy mountains, too. Just imagine waking up in your tower bedroom (which, by the way, must have been a feat to heat) and holding a cup of mead, looking at the distance and thinking "Yes, I am the sire of all my sight can reach". Or maybe "How I will be able to make mortgame payments with these huge utility bills?". Whatever.
