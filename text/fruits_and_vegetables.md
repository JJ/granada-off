# Granada, the orchard

One of the things that will draw your attention in Granada is the
profusion of green matter in the streets. There are not only big boulevards
or avenues lined with trees, you can also see them in the Albayzín if
you watch it from above using Google
maps and also in smallish, single-lane, streets. They grow on the
gardens of the cármenes and by the swimming pools of the suburbial condos. They
are, simply put, everywhere.

But they are not only an ornament or are there help us breathe, which
in fact they do. They also bear many kind of fruits, drawing the attention of the person taking the
promenade, by color or by abundance, mainly during the time that
happens, spring or autumn, when otherwise plain trees all of a sudden
appear to be something else, a promise of abundance with their
branches laden with golden orbs, right there for you to watch, maybe
pick up. 

And there are all kinds of them. One of fruits you will notice right away is the orange. When
the time is appropriate, which is usually in fall and winter, you will
start to see trees in the streets chock-full with orange-colored tennis-sized
balls, and in a few weeks, smashed fruits in the sidewalk and boys
throwing them at each other, like sweet and sour rocks.

Apparently, they have no other utility, even if there are families in
Granada that are below the poverty level and could do with a bit of
fresh fruit, or with a job collecting them and turning them into posh jam. During the civil war and even afterwards, orange peels
were used for recipes such as the
[*sopas cachorreñas*](http://mesabeamalaga.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/sopas-cachorrenas.html)
and even today some places, like Seville
[actually reap the street oranges, collecting 500 tons of the fruit](http://elcorreoweb.es/historico/recogidos-521-629-kilos-de-naranjas-amargas-en-las-calles-y-plazas-de-sevilla-capital-EKEC598480),
although you can
[obtain 700 tons in a good year](http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/1458986/retiradas/las/calles/mas/toneladas/naranjas/amargas.html). Nothing
like that is done here in Granada, which might explain the abundance
of starlings and even parakeets in the skies, binge-eating these
fruits until they can eat no more. If the city environmental department decided to
collect and sell them it would not need to write so many parking
tickets to balance the budget. And maybe would be rid of a few starlings, which are too noisy to stand sometimes.

The fact that there are also orange trees in the yard of the big Mosque in
Córdoba might be the origin of them. Many
[smaller mosques also planted them](http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/jardin_andalusi/cordoba/aljama.htm),
and when their age was gone and mosques turned into churches or razed,
the orange trees became part of the street and remained there for a
time. The Alhambra has its own Patio de los Naranjos, and also the
[Carmen de la Victoria](https://www.tripadvisor.es/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g187441-d1027773-i137902822-Carmen_de_los_Martires-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html). But
not only there were these trees, the Alhambra included
[fields that were exploited by several workers](http://www.otragranada.org/spip.php?article704),
every one paying a rent to the owners, initially some guy who owned
these lands, 
and eventually, for some time, the government until they were
eventually evicted to be substituted by a landscaper paid by the Alhambra. All kind of fruits and vegetables grew there, from
prunes to potatoes. 

Growing your own stuff is still a tradition. From time to time,
coworkers arrive with bags of prunes, or lemons, or almonds, or some
other thing themselves in their garden, or their parents, grow and do
not care to pick up except for giving out, or to sell. Agriculture is
unfortunately turning from a way of living to a hobby, and that is
kind of sad. 

But you can still find these vestiges of the past in the streets of
Granada. The best place to check it out is almost anywhere, although there
are many orange trees in Paseo del Salón along the fringes of the
park. You will see its flowers in summer and fruits almost all year
long. In the middle of the spring, orange blossoms and you can smell
it almost anywhere in the city. These blossoms last for a couple of
days, and you will find the sidewalk dotted with white flakes, the
remains of these beautiful flowers. In this tradition, akin to Sakura,
but which nobody cares about, should be as famous as that one. And is,
at least smell-wise, one of the most enjoyable.

These trees are manured in winter and in spring by the city hall
gardeners. Unlike orange blossom smell,  you will notice
that from far away, since it remains for a whole week sometimes. No
need to get closer in that case. At least you can rest assured that it
is ecological, since it is pure, unadulterated, horse shit. 

Lemons are a whole different story. For some reason, there are no
lemon trees in the streets. They have all gone to
[Chris Stewart's books](https://www.amazon.com/Driving-Over-Lemons-Optimist-Spain/dp/0375709150/ref=as_sl_pc_ss_til?tag=perltutobyjjmere&linkCode=w01&linkId=RRCKPFQAD34SSFUW&creativeASIN=0375709150),
or now seriously, to gardens and private orchards. If you see lemons
here, and you do that quite often, it is usually over a wall or
palisade or sticking out over your head, yours for the taking. Lemon
trees are all by themselves, they do not line up in the street like
orange trees. They are bitter and better left alone. But that means
that lemons are also given out for free, when you buy fish along with
the parsley, or by friends that reap their trees and do not know what
to do with so many of them. Sometimes you find lemons opened up and
laced with cloves, a combination that is supposed to reject mosquitoes
and other insects. Anyway, walk around the Albayzín or El Barranco del
Abogado and you might gather enough lemons for your very own locally
sourced lemonade.

Both are also good places for prickly pears, but the main places are el Barranco and the Sacromonte.
