#Granada, the orchard

One of the things that will draw your attention in Granada is the
profussion of trees in the streets. There are not only big bulevards
or avenues lined with them, you can see them also from above in Google
maps and also in smallish, single-lane, streets. They grow on the
gardens of the carmens and by the swimming pools of the condos. They
are, simply put, everywhere.

But a few fruits draw the attention of the person taking the
promenada, by color or by abundance. One of them is the orange. When
the time is appropriate, which is usually in fall and winter, you will
start to see trees in the streets chock-full with orange-colored
balls, and in a few weeks, smashed fruits in the sidewalk and boys
throwing them at each other, like acid and sweet rocks.

Apparently, they have no other utility, even if there are families in
Granada that are below the poverty level and could do with a bit of
fresh fruit. During the civil war and even afterwards, orange peels
were used for recipes such as the
[*sopas cachorreñas*](http://mesabeamalaga.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/sopas-cachorrenas.html)
and even today some places, like Seville
[actually reap the street oranges, collecting 500 of the fruit](http://elcorreoweb.es/historico/recogidos-521-629-kilos-de-naranjas-amargas-en-las-calles-y-plazas-de-sevilla-capital-EKEC598480),
although you can
[obtain 700 tons in a good year](http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/1458986/retiradas/las/calles/mas/toneladas/naranjas/amargas.html). Nothing
like that is done here in Granada, which might explain the abundance
of starlings and even parakeets in the skies, binge-eating these
fruits until there is not much left.

The fact that there are orange trees in the yard of the big Mosque in
Córdoba might be the origin of them. Many
[smaller mosques also planted them](http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/jardin_andalusi/cordoba/aljama.htm),
and when their age was gone and mosques turned into churches or razed,
the orange trees became part of the street and remained there for a
time. The Alhambra has its own Patio de los Naranjos, and also the
[Carmen de la Victoria](https://www.tripadvisor.es/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g187441-d1027773-i137902822-Carmen_de_los_Martires-Granada_Province_of_Granada_Andalucia.html). If the city environmental department decided to
collect and sell them it would not need to write so many parking
tickets.

So the best place to check them out is almost anywhere, although there
are many orange trees in Paseo del Salón along the fringes of the
park. You will see its flowers in summer and fruits almost all year
long. In winter and in spring they are manured, but you will notice
that from far away, since it remains for a whole week sometimes. No
need to get closer in that case.
