#Haunted mansions

Actually, this thingie above should read mansions that should be haunted. The problem is that haunting, *per se*, does not happen. So, the the phrase that starts with "Actually, this thingie" should actually talk about mansions, houses, abodes that, when seen in a certain light in a movie, are 9 out of 10 times haunted.
You know what I'm talking about: big, imposing, derelict house; boarded windows, a few nasty graffiti here and there, overgrown garden becoming a veritable ecosystems, chipped, decaying paint, and maybe lights in a window at odd times. Well, I haven't checked that last one. But I can guarantee Granada hosts a few of the others.
>As does any self-respecting city, new or old. The "haunting" look is not related to age; left to its own devices, houses start to look haunted in a few year's time, as soon as the "For sale" sign decays and drops. Because capitalism, after all, goes against the grain of the spooky atmosphere. 

The one that comes to mind to me immediately is the one in
[Alamillos de San Cecilio, number 9](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.174618,-3.593425,3a,75y,34.29h,90.04t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sUdLGb1Md4HS3MrGCiYNDlg!2e0?hl=es). Except
for the garden, it's got all the rest. Plus stone balconies, an iron

gate, a stone balustrade, and a door into a windowless room. I would love
to see it from inside. Except I cannot, that is why it is included in
this "haunted" chapter. It would be an excellent target for urban exploration, as is the next one placed in el Barranco del Abogado, between the [Camino nuevo del Cementerio and the Balc√≥n de Granada street](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1692374,-3.585349,3a,75y,131.48h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1so091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Do091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D137.96715%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656). It looks like the kind of condo a washed up artist would habit over in Malibu hills, but it is actually in one of the most authentic neigborhoods in Granada, wit its graffitied status reflecting the fact that it has never, and probably will never, be habited. Besides, it is a house that can be seen from all over, since el Barranco is actually a creek with houses hanging from it; its square glass hall, when hit by the sunlight just right, looks like a flying saucer landed in the slope of the hill.

It is not quite clear what is the origin of the haunting. The fact that it does not look alike any other building in the surroundings, or that maybe the overhanging balcony exceeds the habitability rates or some other public regulation might have something to do with it. The fact is that it has not decayed because it is actually a great structure, concrete and iron plaques, great insulation, or maybe because it is being actively kept until the administrative logjam clears off. When it does, I can imagine it being occupied by an old glory, silver in his temples, that wakes up early in the morning to watch, whisky in hand, the sun rise over Sierra Nevada. In fact, watching sun rise over Sierra Nevada reflected in its glass windows is quite an spectacle.
