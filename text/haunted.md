#Haunted mansions

Actually, this thingie above should read mansions that should be haunted. The problem is that haunting, *per se*, does not happen. So, the the phrase that starts with "Actually, this thingie" should actually talk about mansions, houses, abodes that, when seen in a certain light in a movie, are 9 out of 10 times haunted.
You know what I'm talking about: big, imposing, derelict house; boarded windows, a few nasty graffiti here and there, overgrown garden becoming a veritable ecosystems, chipped, decaying paint, and maybe lights in a window at odd times. Well, I haven't checked that last one. But I can guarantee Granada hosts a few of the others.
>As does any self-respecting city, new or old. The "haunting" look is not related to age; left to its own devices, houses start to look haunted in a few year's time, as soon as the "For sale" sign decays and drops. Because capitalism, after all, goes against the grain of the spooky atmosphere. 

The one that comes to mind to me inmediately is the one in
[Alamillos de San Cecilio, number 9](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.174618,-3.593425,3a,75y,34.29h,90.04t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sUdLGb1Md4HS3MrGCiYNDlg!2e0?hl=es). Except
for the garden, it's got all the rest. Plus stone balconies, an iron

gate, a stone balaustrade, and a door into a windowless room. I would love
to see it from inside. Except I cannot, that is why it is included in
this "haunted" chapter.
