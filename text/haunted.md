#Haunted mansions

Actually, this thingie above should read mansions that should be haunted. The problem is that haunting, *per se*, does not happen. So, the the phrase that starts with "Actually, this thingie" should actually talk about mansions, houses, abodes that, when seen in a certain light in a movie, are 9 out of 10 times haunted.
You know what I'm talking about: big, imposing, derelict house; boarded windows, a few nasty graffiti here and there, overgrown garden becoming a veritable ecosystems, chipped, decaying paint, and maybe lights in a window at odd times. Well, I haven't checked that last one. But I can guarantee Granada hosts a few of the others.
>As does any self-respecting city, new or old. The "haunting" look is not related to age; left to its own devices, houses start to look haunted in a few year's time, as soon as the "For sale" sign decays and drops. Because capitalism, after all, goes against the grain of the spooky atmosphere. 

The one that comes to mind to me immediately is the one in
[Alamillos de San Cecilio, number 9](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.174618,-3.593425,3a,75y,34.29h,90.04t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sUdLGb1Md4HS3MrGCiYNDlg!2e0?hl=es). Except
for the garden, it's got all the rest. Plus stone balconies, an iron

gate, a stone balustrade, and a door into a windowless room. I would love
to see it from inside. Except I cannot, that is why it is included in
this "haunted" chapter. It would be an excellent target for urban exploration, as is the next one placed in el Barranco del Abogado, between the [Camino nuevo del Cementerio and the Balcón de Granada street](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1692374,-3.585349,3a,75y,131.48h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1so091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Do091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D137.96715%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656). It looks like the kind of condo a washed up artist would habit over in Malibu hills, but it is actually in one of the most authentic neighborhoods in Granada, wit its graffitied status reflecting the fact that it has never, and probably will never, be habited. Besides, it is a house that can be seen from all over, since el Barranco is actually a creek with houses hanging from it; its square glass hall, when hit by the sunlight just right, looks like a flying saucer landed in the slope of the hill.

It is not quite clear what is the origin of the haunting. The fact that it does not look alike any other building in the surroundings, or that maybe the overhanging balcony exceeds the habitability rates or some other public regulation might have something to do with it. The fact is that it has not decayed because it is actually a great structure, concrete and iron plaques, great insulation, or maybe because it is being actively kept until the administrative logjam clears off. When it does, I can imagine it being occupied by an old glory, silver in his temples, that wakes up early in the morning to watch, glass of aged whiskey in hand, the sun rise over Sierra Nevada. In fact, watching sun rise over Sierra Nevada reflected in its glass windows is quite an spectacle.

You might want to go downhill from there and back to the Realejo, where in an unassuming and dark alley called Ballesteros you can find a whole haunted palace for yourself, the [Condes de Castillejo palace](http://www.iaph.es/imagenes-patrimonio-cultural-andalucia/thumbnails.php?album=3956). Its renaissance and facade and chamfered balcony would have a place in any touristic guide. But now it is just covered by graffiti and decaying, all by itself, until somebody rediscovers it and pays whatever it takes to un-haunt this XVI century palace, who was probably built by Siloé, one of the treat Renaissance artists in Spain and also author of the cathedral of Granada.

While it is usual enough that nobody cares about an abandoned mansion or an illegal building, it is weird enough the state of dereliction a historic palace is in, at least for a tourist mentality. Almost anywhere else in the world, Italy, France, not to mention the United States of America, a big tourist trap with dioramas and a gift shop would have been built here. Or even just a pub. A non-void. Unfortunately, this is a usual pattern in Spain, which is and maybe will always be a poor country, unable to leverage one of the resources that make the bulk of the gross national product: history. In fact, Granada [depends on the Alhambra for 2.5% of its provincial income](http://www.ideal.es/granada/v/20120503/granada/motores-granada-20120503.html), with 70% of incoming tourists coming just to visit it. I guess that means that city honchos say, what the heck, let us just pile up on it and leave these other things to rot. 

You will find many more in that area and anywhere else in Granada; there is no dearth of abandoned houses, even abandoned caves, presumably abandoned because, you know, they are caves, but there are also spectacular mansions not too far away as the crow flies, but at the other side of the river, in a alley that goes down from the end of the Cervantes Avenue known as Callejón de las Monjas. This house is called [Villa Montserrat](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1619497,-3.5879408,3a,75y,243.11h,121.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSDT82mPJ6hwITNLj5vRBIg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) and is a delicious mixture of moorish, Central European, and a bit of oriental in the ceilings thrown in for good measure, which is said to have belonged to the Duke of Ahumada, the founder of the Civil Guard and built by the beginning of the 20th Century. It is got a ceramic chimney of a impressive turquoise color, a tile of the Virgin of the Angustias by its main door, and stained glasses in several rooms. 

The pagoda-like aspect of its roofs might or might not be the reason why [a Buddhist group called The Way of the Diamond has acquired it recently](http://www.granadahoy.com/article/granada/2140758/villa/montserrat/lugar/para/meditar.html) for [360.000€, which seems like a incredibly good price](http://buildingthepower.com/proyecto/).

> A hundred thousand euros less than that amount will not buy you an apartment just up the street, in the Bola de Oro neighborhood. So I guess this was a pretty good deal. 

If you are into meditation, you might do a bit of haunting yourself in site for a fair price, although by the end of 2015 they seem to offer only [workouts cleaning the space](http://buildingthepower.com/#home).

Haunted and also spiritual, in a way, is the
[Hotel del Reúma, or Rheumatism hotel](http://granadapickups.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/el-hotel-reuma.html),
which is right by the river and in the slope of the Alhambra hill, at
the other side of the Paseo de los Tristes. And 
it was spiritual, and also in a way, since it housed, for a time, the
[Alhambra lodge of the freemasons](http://elintercambiador.estaciondiseno.es/hotel-reuma-arquitectura-abandonada-bajo-la-alhambra/),
after having actually been a hotel for just a few years. It started to
operate in 1910 under the name *Bosque de la Alhambra*, or "Alhambra
forest", but it remained in operation only for a couple of years. It
had to close due to the chill and dampness that pervaded all rooms,
which made for a romantic, albeit uncomfortable, accommodation. Since
it was placed in the slopes of the Alhambra hill, there was absolutely
no sun shining on it from September to March, which are not the months
you want the Sun not to shine. A bit late for the discovery, after two
years of operation, but those were unenlightened times, quite unlike
ours, where we like to shine lights on literally everything, leaving
no stone unturned. 

If there is a candidate for haunting or urban exploration,
this is the one: it was a hospital during the Civil War and also used as
changing rooms for plays taking place in a rig at the other side of the
river. And it is completely shuttered and will probably be for years
to come, since nobody cares too much about it, so it lays there, in
the middle of the woods, rotting and rusting all by itself. 

>More on freemasons on its very own chapter. 

You can check it out from the metallic fence that surrounds it, after
crossing the small bridge from the Paseo de los Tristes. From that side of the river, look up to the Albayzín, where you can
either find other haunting places or work out by just walking around,
looking up, and checking out wrought iron balconies, boarded-shut
windows and "for sale" signs. Places like the derelict *cármenes* in
the Albayzín, the Dar-al-Horra palace, only recently opened, and, of
course, off the Albayzin or looking down the hill to the other side,  the haunted apartment blocks that dot the the outskirts and
suburbs of the city and that are a relic of the real estate
bubble. Places you will be able to watch from outside, but never get
in, specially after dark. Adding to their mystery.
