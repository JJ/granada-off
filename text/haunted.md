# Haunted mansions

Actually, this thingie above should read "mansions that should be
haunted". Or maybe "places that are abandoned for no good reason". Because haunting, *per se*, is not really a thing. So,
the phrase that starts with "Actually, this thingie" should
actually talk about mansions, houses, abodes, or, who knows, merry-go-rounds that, when seen in a
certain light in a movie, are 9 out of 10 times haunted. Or about to
be assaulted by hordes of zombies. 

> Or should that be herds? They move herd-like, that is for sure. Or
> swarm-like.

You know what I'm talking about: big, imposing, derelict house;
boarded windows, a few nasty graffiti here and there, overgrown garden
becoming a veritable ecosystems, chipped, decaying paint, and maybe
lights in a window at odd times. Well, I haven't checked that last
one. But I can guarantee Granada hosts a few places that include all
of the other features.

And then others: gutters overgrown with weeds,
cat dens, and old couples getting in, and, only sometimes, out. In
this sense, the first one that comes to mind is the one in
[Alamillos de San Cecilio, number 9](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.174618,-3.593425,3a,75y,34.29h,90.04t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sUdLGb1Md4HS3MrGCiYNDlg!2e0?hl=es). Except
for the garden, it's got all the rest. Plus stone balconies, an iron

gate, a stone balustrade, and a door into a windowless room. I would love
to see it from inside. Except I cannot, that is why it is included in
this "haunted" chapter. It would be an excellent target for urban
exploration, as is the next one placed in el Barranco del Abogado,

between
the
[Camino nuevo del Cementerio and the Balcón de Granada street](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1692374,-3.585349,3a,75y,131.48h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1so091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Do091epKckuTkUyPs-ZRJrw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D137.96715%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656). It
looks like the kind of condo a washed up artist would inhabit over in
Malibu hills, but it is actually in one of the most authentic
neighborhoods in Granada, with its graffitied status reflecting the
fact that it has never, and probably will never, be habited.

Besides,
it is a house that can be seen from all over, since el Barranco is
actually a creek with houses hanging from it; its square glass hall,
when hit by the sunlight just right, makes it look like a flying saucer landed
on the slope of the hill.

It is not quite clear what is the origin of the haunting. The fact
that it does not look alike any other building in the surroundings at
least if you look from the bottom might be it; although it blends pretty well with
the rest of the hill. Maybe the overhanging balcony exceeds
the habitability rates or some other public regulation might have
something to do with it. The fact is that it has not decayed because
it is actually a great structure, concrete and COR-TEN iron plaques, great
insulation, or maybe because it is being actively kept until the
administrative logjam clears off. When it does, I can imagine it being
occupied by an old glory, silver in his temples, that wakes up early
in the morning to watch, glass of aged whiskey in hand, the sun rise
over Sierra Nevada. In fact, watching sun rise over Sierra Nevada
reflected in its glass windows is quite an spectacle.

But I was not going to devote a chapter to one actually-haunted and
one probably-not-haunted-by-the-time-you-read this house. You might want to go downhill from
there and back to the Realejo, where the first mansion was, where in an unassuming and dark alley
called Ballesteros you can find a whole haunted palace for yourself,
the
[Condes de Castillejo palace](http://www.iaph.es/imagenes-patrimonio-cultural-andalucia/thumbnails.php?album=3956). Its
Renaissance facade and [chamfered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer) balcony would have a place in any
touristic guide, were it not "haunted". The haunting has given it a patina of graffiti and decay,
until somebody rediscovers it and pays whatever it
takes to un-haunt this XVI century palace, who was probably built by
Siloé, one of the treat Renaissance artists in Spain and also author
of the cathedral of Granada. Unhaunted and present in any touristic
guide you might have besides this book.

While it is usual enough that nobody cares about an abandoned mansion
or an (possibly) illegal building, it is weird enough the state of dereliction a
historic palace is in, at least for a tourist mentality or for a place
that lives so much off tourism. Almost
anywhere else in the world, Italy, France, not to mention the United
States of America, a big tourist trap with dioramas and a gift shop
would have been installed here. Or even just a pub. A
non-void, existing, living something. Unfortunately, this is a usual pattern in Spain, which is
and maybe will always be a poor country, unable to leverage one of the
resources that make the bulk of the gross national product:
history. In fact,
Granada
[depends on the Alhambra for 2.5% of its provincial income](http://www.ideal.es/granada/v/20120503/granada/motores-granada-20120503.html),
with 70% of incoming tourists coming just to visit it. I guess that
means that city honchos say, what the heck, let us just pile up on it
and leave these other, unproductive things
that-do-not-show-up-in-any-guide-but-this-one, to rot.  

You will find many more in that area and anywhere else in Granada;
there is no dearth of abandoned houses, even abandoned caves,
presumably abandoned because, you know, they are caves, but there are
also spectacular mansions not too far away as the crow flies, but at
the other side of the river, in a alley that goes down from the end of
the Cervantes Avenue known as Callejón de las Monjas. This house is
called
[Villa Montserrat](https://www.google.es/maps/@37.1619497,-3.5879408,3a,75y,243.11h,121.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSDT82mPJ6hwITNLj5vRBIg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) and
is a delicious mixture of moorish, Central European, and a bit of
oriental in the ceilings thrown in for good measure. This place is said to
have belonged to the Duke of Ahumada, the founder of the Civil Guard
and built by the beginning of the 20th Century. It is got a ceramic
chimney of a impressive turquoise color, a tile of the Virgin of the
Angustias by its main door, and stained glasses in several rooms.  

The pagoda-like aspect of its roofs might or might not be the reason
why
[a Buddhist group called The Way of the Diamond has acquired it recently](http://www.granadahoy.com/article/granada/2140758/villa/montserrat/lugar/para/meditar.html) for
360.000€, which seems like a incredibly good price.

If you are into meditation, you might do a bit of haunting yourself on
site [for a fair price](https://www.facebook.com/budismo.granada/),
although not clear from the web if it is really taking place in this
house. You might want to check it out from outside, in an area that is
almost 100% devoid of tourists, but full of old, derelict houses such
as this one was at one time.

Haunted and also spiritual, in a way, is the
[Hotel del Reúma, or Rheumatism hotel](http://granadapickups.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/el-hotel-reuma.html),
which is right by the river and in the slope of the Alhambra hill,
just opposite the Paseo de los Tristes. And 
it was spiritual, and also in a way, since it housed, for a time, the
[a freemasons lodge which was, properly enough, called "Alhambra"](http://elintercambiador.estaciondiseno.es/hotel-reuma-arquitectura-abandonada-bajo-la-alhambra/),
after having actually been a hotel for just a few years. It started to
operate in 1910 under the name Hotel *Bosque de la Alhambra*, or "Alhambra
forest", but it remained in operation only for a couple of years. It
had to close due to the chill and dampness that pervaded all rooms,
which made for a uncomfortable, albeit romantic, accommodation. Since
it was placed in the slopes of the Alhambra hill, there was absolutely
no sun shining on it from September to March, which are not the months
you want the Sun not to shine. A bit late for the discovery, after two
years of operation, but those were unenlightened times, quite unlike
ours, where we like to shine lights on literally everything, leaving
no stone unturned. 

If there is a candidate for actual haunting or urban exploration,
this is the one: it was a hospital during the Civil War and also used as
changing rooms for plays taking place in a rig at the other side of the
river. And it is completely shuttered and will probably be for years
to come, since nobody cares too much about it, so it lays there, in
the middle of the woods, rotting and rusting all by itself.

>More on freemasons on its very own chapter. 

You can check it out from the metallic fence that surrounds it, after
crossing the small bridge from the Paseo de los Tristes. From that side of the river, look up to the Albayzín, where you can
either find other haunting places or work out by just walking around,
looking up, and checking out wrought iron balconies, boarded-shut
windows and "for sale" signs, side by side spanking new touristic
apartment buildings and other signs of gentrification. Places like the derelict *cármenes* in
the Albayzín, the Dar-al-Horra palace, only recently opened, and, of
course, off the Albayzín or looking down the hill to the other side,  the haunted apartment blocks that dot the the outskirts and
suburbs of the city and that are a relic of the real estate
bubble. Places you will be able to watch from outside, but never get
in, specially after dark. Adding to their mystery. 

Those haunted, half built houses, also left another haunted place: a
[merry go-round](https://www.ideal.es/granada/provincia-granada/noria-olvidada-20180806131826-ntvo.html) that
was used as a publicity gimmick by a real estate company and that has
stayed there, in the same way, for 30 years. You can see pretty well
from the road to Murcia in either direction. [Check it out here, in
Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.2433833,-3.647345,3a,75y,20.4h,102.72t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sSgLfp6UxE0P56mO5ub6OVg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). You
might imagine, watching it, that we are in a permanent state of
fair. That is not the case. But we are in a permanent state of
haunting, even of things, like merry go-rounds, that are not haunted
anywhere else.
