#Hopscotch this book

##Or, how to read it your own way.

There is no particular order in this book. Nothing is more or less
important, nothing should be done before or after everything else. But
a book is a sequential thing, so there is no other way out that put
this chapter before the following one, and that one before the
next. But this has been done in a rather haphazard way.

>Talking about hazards, and since you are asking, no, there is no reason why the first chapter is about earthquakes, as
>in keep away from here for your safety or visit this before a huge
>chasm opens and swallows everything from the *botellÃ³dromo* to the
>Alhambra.

However, some chapters might be more interesting to you than others,
and you might want to read them first. If you consider yourself a geek

>and who does not, nowadays...

read first the Geekery chapter, which, besides, is the longest and
best documented. If you are an Erasmus visitor to the city, read the
chapter about the University. If you like urban art, there is a
chapter I loved to write on graffiti, which I love, too; if you are more curious about urban dwellers,
three chapters on buskers, whorehouses and famous eccentrics plus the
one that describes the quote unquote off-limits parts of Granada might be
the ones for you.

If you like water, you are in luck: there is a chapter on water
*and* another about snow.

All this to say that, really, make your own way through the
stuff. Enjoy it any way you like it. Just like the city.
