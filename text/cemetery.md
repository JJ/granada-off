#The graveyard

A graveyard is a place that is always worth visiting. How people treat
their dead is a quintessential cultural trait so if you want to
understand what is going on with the city and its people, just go
there. Besides, it is usually a nice and quite place where you can
take a walk surrounded by cypresses, flowers, and, well, lots of
corpses, but just do not think about that.
