#The graveyard

Graveyards are places always worth visiting. The way people treat
their dead, and write about them, is a quintessential cultural trait so if you want to
understand what is going on with the city and its people, just go
there. Besides, it is usually a nice and quiet place where you can
take a walk surrounded by cypresses, flowers, and, well, lots of
corpses, but just do not think about that.

So being quiet and far away from town they are also off the beaten
track. Even if there is a map printed by the city with highlights that
you can request at the entrance and follow, I guarantee that
you will find not a soul — no pun intended ——. Actually, pun intended
—— or your money back. In general, in these heathen times, people do
not go to graveyards except if they absolutely need to or, indeed when
they make it their permanent residence. They do it only on All Saints'
Day, the first of 
November, and then they do it droves. Any other day of the year and you might find one or two
persons, a couple of municipal workers, and maybe a parade in the act
of burying someone. Other than that, you are left to yourself to enjoy
the simple pleasure of walking alone surrounded by buried, o,
in some cases, burned remains, of people.

The graveyard in Granada is quite similar to others in Spain. It is
divided in *patios* or yards, every one receiving a name, usually of a
saint. Among cypresses and sometimes bushes, there are tombs, niches,
and, lately, monoliths with plaques holding the names of people whose
ashes have been poured in a cistern. However, its position is one of
the things that make it unique. It sits on top of a hill, in front of
the Alhambra hill, and looking south to the city and Sierra
Nevada. Lately, windows have been opened on the walls so that you can
watch the view from there. There is something poignant and sad about
cemeteries with a nice view; guests there are not able to enjoy it and
in fact visitors should not either, since their main objective there
is to mourn. But you do not have to, so you are entitled to enjoy the
view. I always think about this when I visit the cemetery of Cacela
Velha, in the Algarve, with a incredible view, if it was possible, to
the Atlantic Ocean. However, it is impossible to see it from there,
you check your landscapes at the cemetery gate. That is, probably,
even sadder. 

You will not find really old tombs there; the most ancient come from
the 19th century and, in fact, this particular cemetery was created
in 1805. People were buried here and there before that; during the
Muslim age,
[people were buried in Puerta Elvira](http://www.adurcal.com/enlaces/cultura/zona/historia/xiv/cementerios.htm)
and probably all over the place; every time someone opens a tunnel or
digs for a parking some skeletons surface and are sometimes quickly
hidden or buried some place else to avoid paralyzation of the works
and long delays.

But there are nice sculptures commissioned by wealthy families, and
also the results of popular religiosity, sad manifestations of love to
family. If you go to the niches yard, the one with the nice sights of
the Sierra, you will see many niches where little kids are
buried. They are decorated with little toys and colorful displays that
contradict the sad fate of the residents. Another example of this
popular view of religion is what is called
[el señor del Cementerio](http://www.ugr.es/~pwlac/G01_03Rafael_Briones_Gomez.html),
or the Lord of the Cemetery, a statue representing a long-haired
person in robes that decorates the last dwelling of Manuel Torres, a
popular doctor who died at the beginning of the 20th
century. Apparently, the doctor was loved by his patients, which visited
his tomb and touched this statue, but later on a cult making it a
source of miracles surfaced and a whole ritual evolved around it. When
I visited, some weeks ago, it had probably died off along with the
person that organized it. It is still one of the milestones in the
map, however.

This map will take you also to one of the most curious symbols there:
the shining globe that recalls the faceplate of an spacesuit, with an embedded cross that marks the tomb of one of
the most remarkable engineers in Granada, Emilio Herrera, a person
extensively featured in the geekery chapter, that you are invited to
visit right now.
