#The graveyard

Graveyards are places always worth visiting. The way people treat
their dead, and write about them, is a quintessential cultural trait so if you want to
understand what is going on with the city and its people, just go
there. Besides, it is usually a nice and quiet place where you can
take a walk surrounded by cypresses, flowers, and, well, lots of
corpses, but just do not think about that.

So being quiet and far away from town they are also off the beaten
track. Even if there is a map that you can follow, I guarantee that
you will find not a soul — no pun intended ——. Actually, pun intended
—— or your money back. In general, in these heathen times, people do
not go to graveyards. They do it only on All Saints' Day, the first of
November, and then they do it droves. You might find one or two
persons, a couple of municipal workers, and maybe a parade in the act
of burying someone. Other than that, you are left to yourself to enjoy
the simple pleasure of walking alone surrounded by buried, o,
in some cases, burned remains, of people.
