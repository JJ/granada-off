# The (nearly abandoned) train station

If you are in Granada, it is as likely that you arrived by train as by cruise ship. Unless you happened to be in Sevilla and had a lot of time in your hands plus a real love for trains, it is quite unlikely that you took that mean of transport to enter Granada. In fact, even if you did, and you did it in the last few months, you would have arrived at the train station via riding a coach from Antequera, since the works preparing it for the AVE, the high speed train, have had it closed for the last few months of 2015.

But maybe you have arrived via AVE, which would be a good sign, first because it would mean that I have eventually finished this book, and second because it would mean that the AVE railway has, indeed, arrived eventually to Granada. And you might have noticed strange signs in that trip. For most of the trip, you will have the sun on your right or on your left, because it is going to be travelling south. However, when you arrive in Granada, the sun will play a trick and will change places, because you will be speeding towards the north-east. This is because the high-speed line looks like a mirror image of a J. The top will be in Madrid, the bottom of the J will be in Antequera, nicest station in the middle of nowhere, by the way, and the tail will end up in Granada. If you look at it from the other way, starting in Granada, it means that for around one hundred and odd kilometers you will be getting farther away from Madrid, not getting closer. All in all, it means that the high speed train will save half an hour, maybe a full hour, from the trip you could take in a slightly-irrespetuous-of-the-speed-limits car.

There is probably a good reason for this, and there is one, or several, for the increasing neglect of the railroad in this part of Andalucía. As there must be one for the suppression of red-eye express services to Barcelona, daily services to Madrid, since there are only a couple now, and they take several hours. Once I decided to take a train from Granada to Valencia, which is a good five hours, coffee stops included, by car. It took nine hours, including a change of trains in Linares Baeza.

I guess this is why I talk about this here. There is no track that has been less beaten than the railway tracks. It is probably worth the while, if you are interested in old machinery and utilitarian buildings, to visit the station. You can clearly snap pictures of the Alhambra, San Jerónimo and, to the other side, the bustle of the Camino de Ronda.
