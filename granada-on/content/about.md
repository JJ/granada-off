## What this is about

"Granada On" is, first and foremost, a book about one of the most
incredible cities in the world, Granada in Spain. It is a book about a
living and breathing city, a lived-in city. And it is also a living
and evolving book, written by someone that has lived in Granada most
of his life.

## Vision

Most guidebooks include a narrow concept of beauty or noteworthiness
by selecting a few places based on some criteria that is difficult to
ascertain, but which makes all places essentially the same. High
towers, shopping streets, old stones. The vision of this book is to
focus on the nooks and crannies, the narrative of the city and, in
general, what draws the author attention when he walks the city every
day of his life.

## Mission

To make the reader discover the city, understand it, and live it.
