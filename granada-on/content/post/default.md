## Granada On, the book

This book is about [Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada), a
living city that exists before, during and after the Alhambra, the
paella and the shopping. It is about the graffiti, about the
technology, about urban exploration and about stuff that is in plain
sight and yet almost never seen.

It is about a city to be lived and walked and eaten and drunk. A city
that has to be discovered over and over again.
