<p>Granada Off the Beaten Track, a set of experiencies you should not miss on your third or fourth visit.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h2>

<p>This is the 30th year I have been living in Granada. Every day I follow a new path or double a corner to a street I have never been, I find new graffiti, a derelict house or a statue that very few people have seen and even less care about. One day I will have to write about it, and do it in English, just because.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-title" class="anchor" href="#the-title" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The title</h2>

<p><em>Hacks</em> is the title of a series of books that tell you how to use programming languages, or whatever (there is even a Mind Hacks) in ways you had not tought about before. This book will be more or less the same. It will tell you how to live and experience and do Granada (and maybe somewhere else) in a new way.</p>

<h2>
<a id="you-got-me-but-will-you-speak-about-the-alhambra" class="anchor" href="#you-got-me-but-will-you-speak-about-the-alhambra" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>You got me. But will you speak about the Alhambra?</h2>

<p>I should, shouldn't I? It's unavoidable, but there are excellent books to learn about its history and its art and its legends. So while it is going to be impossible to avoid, in principle there will be no Alhambra hack. Or maybe I should make it the first one to get it out of the way and continue with the rest.</p>

<h2>
<a id="but-again-why" class="anchor" href="#but-again-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But, again, why?</h2>

<p>Lately I have been hanging around in <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a> and they ask all kinds of stuff about Spain, Granada, and I keep answering them in a haphazard way. With this, I pretend to answer and then point them to this repo and/or the Kindle book that will result from it. </p>
